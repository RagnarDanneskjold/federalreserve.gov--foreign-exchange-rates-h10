Manufacturing output moved up 0.4 percent in June, a gain largely due to an increase in motor vehicle assemblies. The output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. The index for utilities rose 2.4 percent as a result of warmer weather than is typical for June boosting demand for air conditioning. The output of mining moved up 0.2 percent for its second consecutive small monthly increase following eight straight months of decline. At 104.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in June was 0.7 percent lower than its year-earlier level.

Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016, is now expected to increase 0.4 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point lower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is now expected to rise 0.7 percent, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than the previous estimate; a smaller increase in the capacity for manufacturing of selected high-technology goods accounts for the downward revision.

Declines in the indexes for manufacturing and utilities in May were slightly offset by a small gain for mining. The output of manufacturing moved down 0.4 percent, led by a large step-down in the production of motor vehicles and parts; factory output aside from motor vehicles and parts edged down 0.1 percent. The index for utilities fell 1.0 percent, as a drop in the output of electric utilities was partly offset by a gain for natural gas utilities. After eight straight monthly declines, the production at mines moved up 0.2 percent. At 103.6 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in May was 1.4 percent below its year-earlier level.

In May, the index for mining moved down 0.3 percent after declining more than 1 percent per month, on average, in the previous four months. The slower rate of decrease for mining output last month was due in part to a reduced pace of decline in the index for oil and gas well drilling and servicing.

Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 1.6 percent in 2013, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than in previous estimates. Relative to the previous estimates, faster gains in the high-technology and motor vehicles industries have been more than offset by slower gains elsewhere in manufacturing.

Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization.  Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have dropped 0.3 percentage point more in 2009; its gains in both 2010 and 2011 were essentially unchanged from what was previously reported.  With these minor revisions, the broad contour of total IP in recent years is similar to previous estimates.  Since the trough of the last recession in June 2009, total IP has reversed about three-fourths of its peak-to-trough decline.</p><p>Capacity utilization rates for recent years were revised down.  The 
revisions show that the rate of capacity utilization for total industry was 0.7 percentage point lower than previously estimated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 0.4 percentage point lower in 2011, primarily as a result of small upward revisions to estimates of industrial capacity. The capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was revised down 0.3 percentage point, and the rate in the final quarter of 2009 was revised down about 0.8 percentage point. </p>]]></description><dc:date>2012-03-30T12:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-03-30T12:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/G17.html#511"><title>Seasonal Factors for auto and truck production have been reestimated</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/G17.html#511</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm">Seasonal factors for auto and truck production</a> have been reestimated using final production data through February 2012 and manufacturers' assembly plans through June 2012; they also reflect the holiday schedule in place from the new domestic autoworkers' agreement signed in the 3rd quarter of 2011.

of industrial capacity for 2012.  Measured fourth quarter to fourth 
quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to rise 1.0 percent this
 year after having increased 1.1 percent in 2011.  Manufacturing 
capacity is estimated to advance 0.9 percent in 2012 after having gained
 0.8 percent in 2011.  Mining capacity is estimated to rise 1.1 percent 
in 2012 after having moved up 2.1 percent in 2011, and capacity at 
electric and natural gas utilities is projected to expand 2.4 percent 
this year, which is 0.4 percentage point faster than the increase 
recorded last year.  These estimates will be updated with the 
publication on March 30, 2012, of the annual revision to industrial 
production, capacity, and capacity utilization.

Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines rose 0.8 percent in February, which more than reversed its decline in January. However, the output of utilities fell 4.5 percent--the drop reflected unseasonably warm weather in February, which reduced the demand for heating after two months of unseasonably cold temperatures. At 95.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 5.6 percent above its year-earlier level.

In the manufacturing sector, output advanced 0.3 percent in November with gains in both durables and nondurables.  The gains among durable goods industries were particularly broad-based; only the production of motor vehicles and parts decreased substantially. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall factory output advanced 0.7 percent.  The output of mines edged lower, but the output of utilities moved up 1.9 percent as the return of more seasonal temperatures boosted the demand for heating.

With the publication of the annual revision to the G.17 on November 7, 2005, the monthly indicators for the industrial production indexes for the twenty industries that previously relied on electric power use were changed to production-worker hours for the period 1997 to the present. Although the indexes of electric power use will no longer be updated, the historical indexes will remain available from the historical data page for the G.17.
