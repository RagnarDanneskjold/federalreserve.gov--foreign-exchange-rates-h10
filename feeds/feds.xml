Rule</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016061</link><description>Taisuke Nakata and Sebastian Schmidt | Macroeconomists are increasingly using nonlinear models to account for the effects of risk in the analysis of business cycles. In the monetary business cycle models widely used at central banks, an explicit recognition of risk generates a wedge between the inflation-target parameter in the monetary policy rule and the risky steady state (RSS) of inflation---the rate to which inflation will eventually converge---which can be undesirable in some practical applications. We propose a simple modification to the standard monetary policy rule to eliminate the wedge. In the proposed risk-adjusted policy rule, the intercept of the rule is modified so that the RSS of inflation equals the inflation-target parameter in the policy rule.</description><dc:date>2016-08-08T15:45:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-061: The Risk-Adjusted Monetary Policy Rule</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-08-08T15:45:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016060"><title>2016-060: The Political Origin of Home Bias: the case of Europe</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016060</link><description>Filippo De Marco and Marco Macchiavelli | We show that politics is at the root of the banks-sovereign nexus that exacerbated the Eurozone crisis. First, government-owned banks or banks with politicians in the board of directors display higher home bias in sovereign debt compared to privately-owned banks throughout the 2010-2013 period. Second, only government-owned banks increased the home bias during the sovereign crisis (moral suasion). We exploit the fact that equity injections (bail-outs) by domestic governments were not directly targeted to politically connected banks to show that, upon receiving such assistance, only government-owned banks purchase domestic debt. Moral suasion is stronger in countries under stress.</description><dc:date>2016-08-03T12:20:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-060: The Political Origin of Home Bias: the case of Europe</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-08-03T12:20:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016059"><title>2016-059: Did the Founding of the Federal Reserve Affect the Vulnerability of the Interbank System to Systemic Risk?</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016059</link><description>Mark Carlson and David C. Wheelock | As a result of legal restrictions on branch banking, an extensive interbank system developed in the United States during the 19th century to facilitate interregional payments and flows of liquidity and credit. Vast sums moved through the interbank system to meet seasonal and other demands, but the system also transmitted shocks during banking panics. The Federal Reserve was established in 1914 to reduce reliance on the interbank market and correct other defects that caused banking system instability. Drawing on recent theoretical work on interbank networks, we examine how the Fed's establishment affected the system's resilience to solvency and liquidity shocks and whether these shocks might have been contagious. We find that the interbank system became more resilient to solvency shocks but less resilient to liquidity shocks as banks sharply reduced their liquidity after the Fed's founding. The industry's response illustrates how the introduction of a lender of last resort can alter private behavior in a way that increases the likelihood that the lender will be needed.</description><dc:date>2016-08-02T12:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-059: Did the Founding of the Federal Reserve Affect the Vulnerability of the Interbank System to Systemic Risk?</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-08-02T12:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016058"><title>2016-058: Does Anyone Listen when Politicians Talk?

The results suggest that political commentaries do influence policy rate expectations in both regions, even after controlling for macroeconomic releases and immediate interest rate expectations. The findings regarding the policy reaction functions reveal that market expectations are mostly rational. There is no evidence that the Federal Reserve responds to political commentaries that suggest rate hikes or easings. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank seems to have steered its policy in line with political commentaries that suggested further easings during the pre-crisis period, consistent with market expectations.</description><dc:date>2016-07-29T10:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-058: Does Anyone Listen when Politicians Talk?

Furthermore, a significant number of countries increase or decrease the stringency of capital regulations over time. The paper investigates the empirical determinants of the variation in the data based on the theories of bank capital regulation. The results show that countries with high average returns to investment and a high ratio of government ownership of banks choose less stringent capital regulation standards. Capital regulations may also be less stringent in countries with more concentrated banking sectors.</description><dc:date>2016-07-15T17:05:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-057: Bank Capital Regulations around the World: What Explains the Differences?</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-07-15T17:05:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016056"><title>2016-056: For Better and for Worse? Effects of Access to High-Cost Consumer Credit</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016056</link><description>Christine L. Dobridge | I provide empirical evidence that the effect of high-cost credit access on household material well-being depends on if a household is experiencing temporary financial distress. Using detailed data on household consumption and location, as well as geographic variation in access to high-cost payday loans over time, I find that payday credit access improves well-being for households in distress by helping them smooth consumption. In periods of temporary financial distress-after extreme weather events like hurricanes and blizzards-I find that payday loan access mitigates declines in spending on food, mortgage payments, and home repairs. In an average period, however, I find that access to payday credit reduces well-being. Loan access reduces spending on nondurable goods overall and reduces housing- and food-related spending particularly. These results highlight the state-dependent nature of the effects of high-cost credit as well as the consumption-smoothing role that it plays for households with limited access to other forms of credit.</description><dc:date>2016-07-14T14:32:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-056: For Better and for Worse?

We evaluate alternative macrofinancial imbalances as vulnerabilities: nonfinancial sector credit, risk appetite of financial market participants, and the leverage and short-term funding of financial firms. We find that nonfinancial credit is a vulnerability: impulses to the credit-to-GDP gap when it is high leads to a recession. Risk appetite leads to an economic expansion in the near-term, but also higher credit and a recession in later years, suggesting an intertemporal tradeoff. Monetary policy is generally ineffective at slowing the economy once the credit-to-GDP gap is high, suggesting important benefits from avoiding excessive credit growth. Financial sector leverage and short-term funding do not lead directly to contractions and thus are not vulnerabilities by our definition.</description><dc:date>2016-07-13T13:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-055: Financial Vulnerabilities, Macroeconomic Dynamics, and Monetary Policy</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-07-13T13:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016054"><title>2016-054: Optimal Unemployment Insurance and International Risk Sharing</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016054</link><description>Stéphane Moyen, Nikolai Stähler, and Fabian Winkler | We discuss how cross-country unemployment insurance can be used to improve international risk sharing. We use a two-country business cycle model with incomplete financial markets and frictional labor markets where the unemployment insurance scheme operates across both countries. Cross-country insurance through the unemployment insurance system can be achieved without affecting unemployment outcomes. The Ramsey-optimal policy however prescribes a more countercyclical replacement rate when international risk sharing concerns enter the unemployment insurance trade-off. We calibrate our model to Eurozone data and find that optimal stabilizing transfers through the unemployment insurance system are sizable and mainly stabilize consumption in the periphery countries, while optimal replacement rates are countercylical overall. Moreover, we find that debt-financed national policies are a poor substitute for fiscal transfers.</description><dc:date>2016-07-06T10:56:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-054: Optimal Unemployment Insurance and International Risk Sharing</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-07-06T10:56:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016052"><title>2016-052: Funding Liquidity Risk and the Cross-section of MBS Returns</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016052</link><description>Yuriy Kitsul and Marcelo Ochoa | This paper shows that funding liquidity risk is priced in the cross-section of excess returns on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). We derive a measure of funding liquidity risk from dollar-roll implied financing rates (IFRs), which reflect security-level costs of financing positions in the MBS market. We show that factors representing higher net MBS supply are generally associated with higher IFRs, or higher funding costs. In addition, we find that exposure to systematic funding liquidity shocks embedded in the IFRs is compensated in the cross-section of expected excess returns - agency MBS that are better hedges to funding liquidity shocks on average deliver lower excess returns - and that these premiums are separate from the premiums associated with prepayment risks.</description><dc:date>2016-06-27T11:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-052: Funding Liquidity Risk and the Cross-section of MBS Returns</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-06-27T11:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016053"><title>2016-053: Labor Force Transitions at Older Ages: Burnout, Recovery, and Reverse Retirement</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016053</link><description>Lindsay Jacobs and Suphanit Piyapromdee | Partial and reverse retirement are two key behaviors characterizing labor force dynamics for individuals at older ages, with half working part-time and over a third leaving and later re-entering the labor force. The high rate of exit and re-entry is especially surprising given the declining wage profile at older ages and opportunities for re-entry in the future being uncertain. In this paper we study the effects of wage and health transition processes as well as the role of accrues work-related strain on the labor force participation on older males. We find that a model incorporating a work burnout-recovery process can account for such reverse retirement behavior that cannot be generated by health and wealth shocks alone, suggesting re-entry patterns result in large part from planned behavior. We first present descriptive statistics of the frequency and timing of re-entry and characteristics of those who re-enter using Health and Retirement Study (HRS) panel data. We then develop and estimate a dynamic model of retirement that captures the occurrence and timing of re-entry decisions observed in the data--as well as the transition to part-time work--while incorporating uncertainty in earnings, health, and stress accumulation. The burnout-recovery process allows us to account of for about 40 percent of re-entry, and one-quarter of the shifts to part-time work with age. We also consider the lower exit and re-entry rates after 2008, and attribute this to high option values of work in an environment where future re-entry is less certain. Consistent with out burnout-recovery model, we see that respondents are more likely to report high levels of job stress as they continue to work when they would have otherwise stopped working, recovered, and re-entered. This offers us some information about the relative option value of work versus the burnout-recovery process.</description><dc:date>2016-06-27T11:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-053: Labor Force Transitions at Older Ages: Burnout, Recovery, and Reverse Retirement</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-06-27T11:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016050"><title>2016-050: Securities Lending as Wholesale Funding: Evidence from the U.S. Life Insurance Industry</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016050</link><description>Nathan Foley-Fisher, Borghan Narajabad, and Stephane Verani | The existing literature implicitly or explicitly assumes that securities lenders primarily respond to demand from borrowers and reinvest their cash collateral through short-term markets. Using a new dataset that matches every U.S. life insurer's bond portfolio, as well as their lending and reinvestment decisions, to the universe of securities lending transactions, we offer compelling evidence for an alternative strategy, in which securities lending programs are used to finance a portfolio of long-dated assets. We discuss how the liquidity and maturity mismatch associated with using securities lending as a source of wholesale funding could potentially impair the functioning of the securities market.</description><dc:date>2016-06-23T09:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-050: Securities Lending as Wholesale Funding: Evidence from the U.S. Life Insurance Industry</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-06-23T09:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016051"><title>2016-051: Occupational Choice, Retirement, and the Effects of Disability Insurance</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016051</link><description>Lindsay Jacobs | There is much variation in the physical requirements across occupations, giving rise to great differences in later-life productivity, disability risk, and the value of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). In this paper, I look at how such differences across occupations affect initial career choice as well as the extent to which SSDI, which insures shocks to productivity due to disability, prompts more people to choose physically intense occupations. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), I estimate a dynamic model of occupational choice and retirement with heterogeneous agents and equilibrium effects on earnings across occupations. I document the differences between blue-collar and white-collar occupations in the effects of declining health and disability on productivity, which affects labor supply in later life and, in the context of a life-cycle model, influences the occupation decision. Thro ugh counterfactual exercises, I show that the additional disability risk in blue-collar jobs relative to white-collar jobs is equivalent to an additional six percentage point reduction in lifetime consumption and that the absence of SSDI, which insures some of this risk, would be equivalent to, respectively, a twelve and seven percent reduction in consumption for those in blue- and white-collar jobs. Furthermore, I find that the presence of SSDI results in three percent more individuals choosing blue-collar occupations, which is comparable to the effect on occupation selection resulting from an eight-percent increase in blue-collar earnings. This overall effect, however, masks the importance of the selection of less risk-averse individuals into blue-collar jobs and the equilibrium effects on wages; earnings for the most risk-averse type would have to be nearly fifteen percent greater to choose blue-collar occupations in the absence of SSDI.</description><dc:date>2016-06-23T09:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-051: Occupational Choice, Retirement, and the Effects of Disability Insurance</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-06-23T09:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016049 "><title>2016-049: Monetary Policy, Real Activity, and Credit Spreads: Evidence from Bayesian Proxy SVARs</title><link>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016049 </link><description>Dario Caldara and Edward Herbst | This paper studies the interaction between monetary policy, financial markets, and the real economy. We develop a Bayesian framework to estimate proxy structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) in which monetary policy shocks are identified by exploiting the information contained in high frequency data. For the Great Moderation period, we find that monetary policy shocks are key drivers of fluctuations in industrial output and corporate credit spreads, explaining about 20 percent of the volatility of these variables. Central to this result is a systematic component of monetary policy characterized by a direct and economically significant reaction to changes in credit spreads. We show that the failure to account for this endogenous reaction induces an attenuation bias in the response of all variables to monetary shocks.</description><dc:date>2016-06-17T12:31:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-049: Monetary Policy, Real Activity, and Credit Spreads: Evidence from Bayesian Proxy SVARs</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-06-17T12:31:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016048"><title>2016-48: News versus Sentiment: Predicting Stock Returns from News Stories</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/index.htm#2016048</link><description>Steven L.

Dunn and Daniel J. Vine | Motor vehicle dealerships in the United States tend to hold inventories equivalent to around 65 days' worth of sales, a relatively high level that has been nearly unchanged for 50 years. Despite playing a prominent role in the volatility of U.S. business cycles, very little is known about why the auto industry targets inventory stocks at such a high level. We use a panel of inventory and sales data from 41 vehicle brands over 30 years and the solutions to two well-known inventory planning problems to show that vehicle inventories appear to be related to (1) the size of dealership franchise networks, which tend to be large; (2) product variety, which tends to be high; and (3) the volatility of new vehicle sales, which also tends to be high. We show that differences across brands in these variables explain a good bit of the cross-section dispersion in brand inventory-sales ratios. Offsetting changes in these factors over time also help explain why the industry's overall inventory-sales ratio has been quite flat for many decades. More recently, the net increase observed in the inventory-sales ratio in the past couple of years is in contrast to fit of the model, which might suggest that some of that increase could reverse in the coming years.</description><dc:date>2016-05-27T13:05:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>2016-47: Why are Inventory-Sales Ratios at U.S. Auto Dealerships so High?</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-05-27T13:05:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>FEDS</cb:keyword></cb:news></item></rdf:RDF>
