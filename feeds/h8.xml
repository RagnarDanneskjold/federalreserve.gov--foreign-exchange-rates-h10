The adjustments are generally made using the figures reported in the H.8 Notes on the Data.  A ratio procedure is used to adjust past levels to make them comparable with current levels.

The seasonally adjusted data released on July 13, 2007--both the H.8
statistical release and the associated historical data--were based
inadvertently on a set of newly estimated seasonal factors. These
seasonal factors did not represent our final estimates and should not
have been published. 
In today's H.8 statistical release and in the associated historical
data, we have restored the previous set of seasonal factors. In
addition, we have corrected the H.8 statistical release of July 13,
2007, by restoring the previous set of seasonal factors to those data.
We will publish newly estimated seasonal factors when they have been
finalized.</description><dc:date>2007-07-20T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for July 11, 2007</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2007-07-20T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#145"><title>Changes to Items Reported on the Release for July 4, 2007</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#145</link><description>Effective with this release of data for July 4, 2007, several changes have been made to the balance sheet items reported for large and small domestically chartered commercial banks:


For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of large domestically chartered banks (pages 5 and 7), former item 12a, "State and local government" loans, and former item 12b, "Agricultural" loans, have been discontinued and the remaining three items under item 12 have been renumbered as 12a through 12c.  Data for the two discontinued items have been aggregated into renumbered item 12b, "All other loans."  
  

For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of small domestically chartered banks (pages 9 and 10), former item 11, "Security" loans, has been discontinued and data for this item have been aggregated into existing item 12, "Other loans and leases."



For memo items of large domestically chartered banks (page 13), former item 34, "Securitized business loans," has been discontinued.  On the same page, new item 34, "Securitized real estate loans," has been added to the memo items for both large and small domestically chartered banks.  
 

The data also reflect shifts in reporters between the large and small domestic bank reporting panels.</description><dc:date>2007-07-13T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Changes to Items Reported on the Release for July 4, 2007</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2007-07-13T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#144"><title>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for April 4, 2007</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#144</link><description>The adoption by some banks of FAS 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (FVO), affected commercial bank balance sheet data for April 4, 2007. The "Notes on the Data" section on page 14 of the H.8 Statistical Release contains information on the affected balance sheet items.Under FVO, banks generally have an irrevocable option to elect a fair value measurement for most financial assets and liabilities at their inception.  In addition, at the time of FVO adoption, banks have a one-time option to convert a broad array of existing asset and liability items to a fair value measurement basis. A bank that elects to adopt FVO must also adopt FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements.

The original amounts of these consolidations reported for December 17 on the H.8 release dated December 29, 2003, have been revised as follows: H.8 balance sheet item 4, other securities, from $6 billion to about $7 billion, balance sheet item 6, commercial and industrial loans, from $9 billion to about $17 billion, and balance sheet item 12, other loans and leases, from $13 billion to about $47 billion.</description><dc:date>2004-01-16T10:47:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Revised Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for December 17, 2003</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2004-01-16T10:47:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#140"><title>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for October 8, 2003</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#140</link><description>A number of balance sheet items have changed as a result of declines in some banks' reported consolidations of variable interest entities (VIEs). Most of these declines reflect some banks' decisions to stop consolidating their VIEs in response to the announcement by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on October 9 that it had decided to defer the implementation of its Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities from the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. For further information, please see the FASB website, www.fasb.org. In addition, a small part of the decline reflects a restructuring of some VIEs so that they no longer need to be consolidated on bank balance sheets. The balance sheet items affected are other securities, item 4, other loans and leases, item 12, and borrowings from others, item 24. Some of these changes extend back to July 2. Revised data for the H.8 statistical release are available on the Board's website, www.federalreserve.gov/releases.</description><dc:date>2003-10-17T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for October 8, 2003</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2003-10-17T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#139"><title>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for October 1, 2003</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#139</link><description>Commercial bank balance sheet data for October 1, 2003, have been affected by consolidations of the assets and liabilities of several variable interest entities onto the balance sheets of the banks that sponsor them.

Monthly estimates of total bank credit and its major components,
seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, have been extended
back from January 1973, the former start date for all the bank credit
series, to January 1947. The components that have been extended are
holdings of U.S. government securities, holdings of other securities,
and the following loan categories: commercial and industrial, real
estate, consumer, security, and "all other."

Data in the H.8 are for all commercial banks in the United States,
which consist of domestically chartered banks and foreign-related
institutions (mainly U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks). The
data for 1973 through 1987 report totals for all institutions as well
as subtotals for domestically chartered banks and for foreign-related
institutions; beginning in 1988, the data are further disaggregated
between large and small domestically chartered banks. The extended data
(1947-72) show only all-institution totals.

As with the current data, the extended monthly data are prorated
averages of Wednesday values. The weekly Wednesday data underlying the
monthly averages mix actual historical observations with estimates that
are based on linear interpolations of semimonthly, monthly, and, in a
few cases, lower-frequency observations.  

Several bank credit series received generally minor revisions for
the 1973-87 period when the longer time series were introduced.</description><dc:date>2002-07-29T16:16:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Extension of Major Bank Credit Series to 1947</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2002-07-29T16:16:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#136"><title>Discontinuation of District-specific balance sheet data</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/H8.html#136</link><description>Effective with this edition of the H.8 statistical release, the Federal Reserve is discontinuing the publication of the District-specific balance sheet data of large, domestically chartered banks that appeared on pages 11 through 14 of the release. 
The reason for the change is that, with the ability of banks to establish branches virtually nationwide as of June 1, 1997, a number of large bank holding companies have converted banks located across several Federal Reserve Districts into branches of a single bank. These consolidations have significantly shifted bank balance sheet items among Federal Reserve Districts, further weakening the connection between banking data reported separately by Federal Reserve District and actual banking activities in each District. 
However, the item coverage of the aggregate balance sheets of large banks in the H.8 has been expanded to retain the national totals of some of the items in the District tables that had not appeared in the national tables. As a result, the H.8 now reports the large bank data on four pages rather than two. </description><dc:date>2002-07-29T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Discontinuation of District-specific balance sheet data</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2002-07-29T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item></rdf:RDF>
