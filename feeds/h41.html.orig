The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST), which was enacted on December 4, 2015, requires that aggregate Federal Reserve Bank surplus not exceed $10 billion.  Therefore, any amount of aggregate Reserve Bank surplus that exceeds this limit will be remitted to the U.S. Treasury.  The line "Interest on Federal Reserve Notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 6 has been replaced with "Earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury" and footnotes to tables 1, 5, and 6 have been similarly modified.  <br />
                    <br />The amounts of the line items "Other liabilities and capital" on table 1, and "Surplus" on tables 5 and 6 reflect the payment of approximately $19.3 billion to Treasury on December 28, 2015, which was necessary to reduce aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to the $10 billion limitation in the FAST Act.</description>

The release will not change in any other way; the removal of the Principal Federal Economic Indicator designation will not affect the contents of the release, or the manner of its publication.

<p>
                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," reflects the closing of the American International Group, Inc. (AIG) recapitalization plan, which occurred on January 14, 2011.  The recapitalization plan was designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Federal Reserve.  Upon closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, specifically the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), were used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan), including accrued interest and fees, and then to redeem a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  The remaining FRBNY preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC and AIA Aurora LLC, valued at approximately $20 billion, were purchased by AIG through a draw on the Treasury's Series F preferred stock commitment and then transferred by AIG to the Treasury as consideration for the draw on the available Series F funds.<br />  <br />The weekly average values shown in table 1 reflect, as of January 14, 2011, the repayment by AIG of the "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net" and the "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and the distribution of the "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent."<br /> <br />The H.4.1 statistical release continues to show average amounts for "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net," "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent," even though all funding commitments to AIG have been terminated, to provide a complete disaggregation of changes in assets and liabilities from the corresponding week one year ago.</p>

<p>The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to reflect an accounting policy change that will result in a more transparent presentation of each Federal Reserve Bank's capital accounts and distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Although the accounting policy change does not affect the amount of residual earnings that the Federal Reserve Banks distribute to the U.S. Treasury, it may affect the timing of the distributions.  Consistent with long-standing policy of the Board of Governors, the residual earnings of each Federal Reserve Bank, after providing for the costs of operations, payment of dividends, and the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in, are distributed weekly to the U.S. Treasury.  The distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is made in accordance with the Board of Governor's authority to levy an interest charge on the Federal Reserve Banks based on the amount of each Federal Reserve Bank's outstanding Federal Reserve notes.  </p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2011, as a result of the accounting policy change, on a daily basis each Federal Reserve Bank will adjust the balance in its surplus account to equate surplus with capital paid-in and, in addition, will adjust its liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Previously these adjustments were made only at year-end.  Adjusting the surplus account balance and the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is consistent with the existing requirement for daily accrual of many other items that appear in the Board's H.4.1 statistical release.  The liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury will be reported as "Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 10.  Previously, the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in and the amount of the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury were included in "Other capital accounts" in table 9 and in "Other capital" in table 10.</p>

<p>
                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to report the funds held as agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) related to the recapitalization plan announced by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) on September 30, 2010.  The recapitalization plan, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2011, is designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY.  Pending the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain AIG asset dispositions will be held by the FRBNY as agent.  </p>
<p>At the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, most notably the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), will be used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan) and then to retire a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC (preferred interests) taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  Alternatively, if the recapitalization plan is terminated under the terms of the plan, then the proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA and the sale of ALICO will be used to redeem the preferred interests in accordance with the AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC limited liability company agreements, and any excess proceeds from these transactions, as well as proceeds from the disposition of other assets, will be used to repay the AIG loan.  </p>
<p>The FRBNY began to hold as agent funds from the cash proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA on October 29, 2010, and from the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO on November 1, 2010.  </p>
<p>The funds held by the FRBNY as agent from the disposition of the AIG assets are reported in table 1 and are included in "Other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.</p>

As a result of this expansion, the line "Dealers" under the heading "Reverse repurchase agreements" will be replaced with "Others" in table 1. Currently, the set of counterparties in the "Others" category is primary dealers and an eligible set of money market funds.</p>

                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information on term deposits held by depository institutions.  Term deposits are a new tool that the Federal Reserve could use to manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions.  </p>
<p>On May 28, 2010, the Federal Reserve announced a schedule for three small-value auctions of term deposits to be offered through its Term Deposit Facility (TDF).  These auctions are intended to ensure the effective operation of the TDF and to help eligible institutions become familiar with the term deposit program.  The first auction was conducted on June 14, 2010, and settlement occurred on June 17, 2010.  The small-value TDF auctions are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy. </p>
<p>Information on the amount of term deposits outstanding is presented on table 1, table 10, and table 11.  The maturity distribution of term deposits is presented in table 2.</p>

(AIG).  In addition, the release has been modified to incorporate fair value adjustments associated with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  </p>
<p>Consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the AIG revolving credit extension has been reduced by a revision of $1,255 million to the loan restructuring adjustment.  The restructuring adjustment is related to the loan modification that eliminated the floor on the Libor rate, announced on March 2, 2009, and that was first incorporated in reported figures beginning with the July 30, 2009, H.4.1 release.  The restructuring adjustment recognizes the economic effect of the reduced interest rate on the revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit extension. The revised restructuring adjustment incorporates quarterly updates as of December 31, 2009, of estimates of factors such as interest rates and future cash flow streams that are used to value the original loan restructuring adjustment.  The Federal Reserve expects that the credit extension, including interest and commitment fees under the modified terms, will be fully repaid.</p>
<p>The weekly average balance of the credit extended to AIG shown in table 1 reflects holdings from March 25, 2010, through Wednesday, March 31, 2010.*  The balance for the first six days of this reporting week reflects the loan restructuring adjustment prior to its revision.  The balance for the final day of the reporting week reflects the revised loan restructuring adjustment.  </p>
<p>Several items on the release have been modified to include fair value adjustments associated with the TALF.  A fair value adjustment to the TALF loans extended by FRBNY is recorded in "Other Federal Reserve assets" in table 1 and "Other assets" in table 10 and in table 11.  This fair value adjustment of $557 million reflects the value of the future interest received by FRBNY that is paid to the TALF LLC to provide credit protection.  The adjustment is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the fair value of the liability to the U.S. Treasury related to its beneficial interest in the TALF LLC recorded in "Other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and "Other liabilities" in table 10 and in table 11.  The fair value adjustments associated with the TALF will be updated quarterly. </p>

                    <p>For release at<br />4:30 p.m. EDT<br />November 19, 2009</p>
<p>The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information related to TALF LLC, a limited liability company formed to purchase and manage any asset-backed securities that might be received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) in connection with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  This information will be presented in a new table 8, "Information on Principal Accounts of TALF LLC."  The release has also been modified to include information related to the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC.  This information is presented in table 1, in table 8, in table 9, and in table 10.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the TALF under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  Under the TALF, the FRBNY extends loans to eligible borrowers to finance the purchase of eligible asset-backed securities (ABS) that serve as the collateral for the loans.  The loans provided through the TALF are non-recourse, meaning that the obligation of the borrower can be discharged by surrendering the collateral to the FRBNY.  The loans are extended for the market value of the security less an amount known as a haircut.  As a result, the borrower bears the initial risk of a decline in the value of the security.  TALF LLC has committed, for a fee, to purchase all ABS received by FRBNY in conjunction with a TALF loan at a price equal to the TALF loan plus accrued but unpaid interest.  Purchases of these securities are funded first through the fees received by the LLC and any interest the LLC has earned on its investments.  In the event that such funding proves insufficient, the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) will provide additional subordinated debt funding to the TALF LLC to finance up to $20 billion of asset purchases.  Subsequently, the FRBNY will finance any additional purchases of securities by providing senior debt funding to TALF LLC.  Thus, the TARP funds provide credit protection to FRBNY.</p>
<p>
                      <br />The Federal Reserve has completed its evaluation and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of TALF LLC will be consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the FRBNY in the preparation of the statements of condition shown on the release. Although the U.S. Treasury provides credit protection to the FRBNY, the FRBNY is the more closely associated beneficiary of the LLC because it directs the significant financial activities of the TALF LLC. </p>
<p>
                      <br />The consequences of this consolidation appear on the release in the following ways.  Any extensions of credit from the FRBNY to TALF LLC are eliminated, as is the accrued interest on such loans.  The net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC are included in "total factors supplying reserve funds" in table 1 and in "assets" in table 9 and in table 10.  The liabilities of TALF LLC to entities other than the FRBNY are included in "other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and in "other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.<br />Information on the principal accounts of TALF LLC is presented separately in a new table 8.  This table presents the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC, which comprise the fair value of the ABS holdings of TALF LLC and other investments that result from the initial funding provided by the U.S. Treasury, fees paid by the FRBNY, and interest received on investments.  In addition, the table presents the book value of the outstanding principal of the loan extended by the FRBNY, the book value of the accrued interest payable to the FRBNY, and the book value of the funding provided by the U.S. Treasury to TALF LLC, which includes the accrued interest payable to the U.S. Treasury.<br />
