                    <br />SPECIAL NOTICE<br />
                    <br />Data on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January 2011. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.[1] The maximum revision to total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any maintenance period was $956 million; most revisions were less than $500 million. <br />
                    <br />A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and seasonal factors is available under <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/annualreview.htm">"Annual review of break and seasonal factors"</a> on the Federal Reserve's website. Historical data, updated each week, are available from the <a href="../datadownload/default.htm">Data Download Program</a> website.<br />
                    <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at each depository institution.  Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions.  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the low-reserve tranche is $71.0 million, rising to $79.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.  <br />Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from reserve requirements.  Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30).  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the reserve requirement exemption is $11.5 million, rising to $12.4 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.<br />

                    <br />As stated in the April 5, 2012, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20120405a.htm">press release</a>, the Federal Reserve Board is in the process of simplifying the administration of reserve requirements. The first steps in this process include discontinuing "as of" adjustments related to deposit revisions, replacing all other as-of adjustments with direct compensation, and eliminating the contractual clearing balance program. As a result, required clearing balances and adjustments to compensate for float are zero beginning with the two weeks ending July 25, 2012. All other as-of adjustments are zero beginning with the two weeks ending August 8, 2012. These items are referenced in several footnotes in table 2 of the release.<br />

                  <description xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/" xmlns:cb="http://www.cbwiki.net/wiki/index.php/Specification_1.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">For release at <br />4:30 P.M. EDT <br />October 27, 2011 <br />
                    <br />SPECIAL NOTICE <br />
                    <br />Data on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result <br />of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal <br />factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January <br />2010. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory <br />changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve <br />tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.1 The maximum revision to total <br />reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any <br />maintenance period was $2.0 billion; most revisions were less than $700 million. <br />
                    <br />A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and <br />seasonal factors is available under "Annual review of break and seasonal factors" <br />on the Federal Reserve's website (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/hist/">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/hist/</a>). <br />Historical data, updated each week, are available there as well. <br />
                    <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br />1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent <br />against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at <br />each depository institution. Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed <br />each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate <br />of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions. For all reserve <br />maintenance periods ending in 2011, the low-reserve tranche is $58.8 million, <br />rising to $71.0 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. <br />Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 <br />million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from <br />reserve requirements. Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year <br />by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all <br />depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30). For all <br />reserve maintenance periods ending in 2011, the reserve requirement exemption is <br />$10.7 million, rising to $11.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. <br />

                    <br />The Board's H.3 statistical release, "Aggregate Reserves of Depository<br />Institutions and the Monetary Base," reflects the closing of the American<br />International Group, Inc. (AIG), recapitalization plan, which occurred on<br />January 14, 2011. The recapitalization plan was designed to restructure and<br />facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S.<br />Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Upon closing of the<br />recapitalization plan, the credit extended to AIG by the Federal Reserve Bank<br />of New York under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan), including accrued<br />interest and fees, was repaid in full. The AIG loan is reported in the "Credit<br />extended to American International Group, Inc., net" category of total and<br />other borrowings from the Federal Reserve, which is shown in table 1a of the<br />H.3 statistical release. <br />
                    <br />The average value of "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc.,<br />net" for the two-week period ending January 26, 2011, reflects the closing of<br />the AIG recapitalization plan. The average value for the two-week period<br />ending January 26, 2011, is greater than zero because the AIG loan was repaid<br />in full on January 14, the second day of this two-week period. Table 1a will<br />continue to show historical values for "Credit extended to American<br />International Group, Inc., net" to provide a complete disaggregation of total<br />and other borrowings from the Federal Reserve for past periods.<br />

                    <p>The H.3 statistical release indicates that nonborrowed reserves of depository institutions were negative for much of 2008 but more recently have turned positive.</p>
<p>By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to the sum of credit extended through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs and credit extended through certain Federal Reserve liquidity facilities.  Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve are presented in table 1a of the release.  Over much of 2008, in order to maintain a level of total reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's objective for the federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves were offset through a nearly commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which was accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities and other assets.  The negative level of nonborrowed reserves was an arithmetic result of the fact that borrowings from the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities were larger than total reserves.<br />
                    </p>
<p>More recently, nonborrowed reserves have again turned positive.  This development is purely an arithmetic result, in this case of the fact that a large volume of reserves has recently been provided through channels that, for purposes of the Federal Reserve's statistical releases, are not considered borrowings.  These channels include foreign currency swap arrangements with foreign central banks and certain special purpose vehicles.  Credit extended to these special purpose vehicles are not shown on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  Rather, as noted on the H.4.1 statistical release, the assets of these vehicles are consolidated onto the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and consequently credit extended to these special purpose entities is not treated as a borrowing for purposes of the H.3 statistical release.</p>

                    <p>
The H.3 statistical release indicates that nonborrowed reserves of
depository institutions have declined substantially since mid-December
to a level that is now negative. This development reflects the
provision of a large volume of reserves through the Term Auction
Facility (TAF) and has no adverse implications for the availability of
reserves to the banking system.</p>

<p>By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves
minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to credit extended
through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs as well
as credit extended through the TAF. To maintain a level of total
reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's target
federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves must generally be
met by a commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which is
accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of
securities and other assets. The negative level of nonborrowed reserves
is an arithmetic result of the fact that TAF borrowings are larger than
total reserves.</p>
