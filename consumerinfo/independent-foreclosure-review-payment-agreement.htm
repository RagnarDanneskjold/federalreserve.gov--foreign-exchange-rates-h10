<h2>August 8, 2016 Update: Payments to nearly 650,000 borrowers of servicers supervised by the Federal Reserve who cashed or deposited their initial checks to begin on August 8</h2>
<p>At the direction of the Federal Reserve, on August 8 and 15, the paying agent, Rust Consulting, Inc. (Rust) will mail payments to nearly 650,000 eligible borrowers of Federal Reserve supervised servicers who cashed or deposited their initial checks from the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR) Payment Agreement by the March 31, 2016 deadline. The redistribution of funds remaining from the IFR Payment Agreement that were attributable to Federal Reserve supervised servicers will provide a total of over $80 million to borrowers, consistent with the Federal Reserve's intention to distribute the maximum amount of funds to borrowers potentially affected by deficient servicing and foreclosure practices.</p>
<p>Under the redistribution, every eligible loan will receive a payment of $124.30. Borrowers receiving a redistribution payment will have the opportunity to request a name on a payment to be changed, a payment to be split, or a payment to be reissued. All requests must be received by Rust no later than <strong>September 30, 2016</strong>. In early-November, there will be a one-time mailing of redistribution check reissuances to accommodate all reissue, payee change, and split check requests. All redistribution checks will expire on <strong>December 31, 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>Servicers covered include GMAC Mortgage, Goldman Sachs/Litton Loan Servicing, Morgan Stanley/Saxon Mortgage Services, and SunTrust. In addition, some borrowers whose loans were serviced by HSBC or JPMorgan Chase may be covered. HSBC and JPMorgan Chase borrowers should contact Rust at <strong>1-888-952-9105</strong> to determine whether their loan was serviced by the part of the servicing operations of those two companies that is supervised by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>For borrowers who did not cash or deposit their initial distribution check by the March 31, 2016 deadline, the Federal Reserve has instructed Rust to correct any applicable tax reporting from that payment with the Internal Revenue Service and mail the borrower a corrected tax reporting document. Corrected tax reporting documents are expected to mail in August.</p>

                <h2>
           Payment Agreement 
        </h2>
       
          <p>In January 2013, thirteen mortgage servicing companies subject to enforcement actions for  deficient practices in mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing&nbsp;reached  an agreement in principle with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to provide more than  $9.3 billion in cash payments and other assistance to help borrowers. The sum  includes $3.6 billion in direct cash payments to  borrowers covered by the agreement and $5.7  billion in other foreclosure prevention assistance, such as loan modifications  and forgiveness of deficiency judgments. In July 2013, one additional  mortgage servicing company joined the payment agreement, bringing the total  number of mortgage servicing companies participating in the payment agreement  to 14. With the addition of that  servicer, $230 million in direct cash  payments will be made to GMAC Mortgage borrowers under the agreement. In August 2013, EverBank also reached an agreement to pay approximately  $37 million in cash payments to more than 32,000 eligible mortgage borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For the participating servicers,  fulfillment of the agreement satisfies the foreclosure review requirements of  enforcement actions issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of Thrift  Supervision in  April and September 2011 and April 2012. </p>
          <p>The  agreement has been memorialized by amendments to the consent orders for  each of the  initial group of 13 participating servicers as of February 28, 2013,  for GMAC Mortgage as of July 26, 2013, and for EverBank as of August 23, 2013.  The amendments to the consent  orders are  publicly available on the websites of the <a href="http://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2013/nr-ia-2013-35.html">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/enforcement/20130228a.htm">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</a>. <br />
            <br />
            The OCC and the Federal Reserve accepted this  agreement because it provides the greatest benefit to consumers subject to  unsafe and unsound mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices during the  relevant period in a more timely manner than would have occurred under the Independent  Foreclosure Review process. <br />
            <br />
            Participating servicers under the agreement, including their current and former affiliates covered under the agreement, include:&nbsp;</p>

          <p> As a result of this agreement, the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/independent-foreclosure-review.htm">Independent Foreclosure Review</a>, which  involved case-by-case reviews, has ceased at the participating servicers and  been replaced with a broader framework allowing all of the  borrowers  of the participating servicers covered by the agreement to receive compensation significantly more  quickly. </p>
          <h2>Borrowers Covered  Under the Payment Agreement</h2> 
            Borrowers whose mortgage loan was serviced by one of the 15  participating servicers and who were involved in a foreclosure action on their primary residence between  January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010, will receive compensation.&nbsp; Borrowers are included, whether or not they  filed a request for review form. <strong>Borrowers are not required to take any additional steps to receive payments.</strong></p>
            <p>Borrowers covered by the agreement are expected to receive compensation ranging from  hundreds of dollars up to $125,000, depending on the type of possible servicer  error. <br />
          <h2> Payment Process</h2>
           <p>A Paying Agent, Rust Consulting Inc., has been retained to administer payments to borrowers on behalf of all the servicers except EverBank. Borrowers whose mortgages were serviced by the initial group of 13 participating servicers were contacted by Rust Consulting beginning in March 2013 with  information regarding their payment. Borrowers whose mortgages were serviced by GMAC Mortgage were contacted by Rust Consulting in December 2013 with information regarding their payment, and payments were mailed to most GMAC Mortgage borrowers at the end of January 2014.  The majority of payments to all servicers except EverBank have now been sent, with the remaining payments expected to be mailed by the summer of 2014.  If a borrower has requested a check to be split amongst borrowers or a change of payee, those checks take longer to process. </p>
           <p>
           The Paying Agent for the EverBank agreement is Epiq Systems.  For questions related to the EverBank agreement, please visit <a href="http://www.EverBankIndependentForeclosureReview.com">www.EverBankIndependentForeclosureReview.com</a> or you can contact Epiq Systems at 1-877-819-9754. </p>  
            <p>Receiving a payment will not prevent borrowers  from taking any action they may wish to pursue related to their foreclosure. Servicers  are not permitted to ask borrowers to sign a waiver of any legal claims they  may have against their servicer in connection with receiving payment.</p>
          <p>Borrowers can call Rust Consulting, Inc. at 1-888-952-9105 to update their   contact information, to verify that they are covered by the payment agreements, or to inquire about the status of their payment. </p>
