The percent changes in selected asset and liability items are shown on page 1 of the release; percent changes for other series shown on the release are available for customizable download through the Federal Reserve Board's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload">Data Download Program (DDP)</a>.  The percent changes will be updated weekly.  Data for a new month, quarter, or year will be published simultaneously with complete weekly data for the new month, quarter, or year.  Except for being renumbered, all other pages of the H.8 release are unchanged.<br />
                    <br />The percent changes have been adjusted to remove the effects of nonbank structure activity of $5 billion or more, as well as the estimated effects of the initial consolidation of certain variable interest entities (FIN 46) and off-balance-sheet vehicles (FAS 166/167).  The adjustments are generally made using the figures reported in the H.8 Notes on the Data.  A ratio procedure is used to adjust past levels to make them comparable with current levels.  For more information on how the H.8 release data are constructed, see <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/about.htm">About the Release</a>.<br />

                    <p>Effective with this release, several changes, summarized below, have 
been made to the data and the line items shown on the H.8 release. These 
changes relate to the adoption, as of July 1, 2009, of a single reporting 
form for all weekly reporters (see the Federal Reserve Board's notice 
published in the <i>Federal Register</i>, 74 FR 10739). Historical data 
have been revised to reflect these changes. In addition, data from the H.8 
release are now available for customizable download through the Federal 
Reserve Board's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=H.8">Data 
Download Program (DDP)</a>. These data will be updated weekly with the H.8 
release. </p>
<OL>
<li>The line items on loans now include the loans that banks hold in 
trading accounts. Previously, loans that banks held in trading accounts 
were included in trading account securities. </li>
<li>Derivatives with a positive fair value and other trading assets are 
now shown as trading assets not included in bank credit. Previously, 
derivatives with a positive fair value and other trading assets were 
included in securities in bank credit. </li>
<li>The set of line items shown on the release has been changed.
<uL>
<li>The set of line items shown on the release is now identical for each 
bank group (all commercial banks; domestically chartered commercial banks; 
large domestically chartered commercial banks; small domestically 
chartered commercial banks; and foreign-related institutions in the U.S.). 
As a result, more line items are now shown on the release for small 
domestically chartered banks and foreign-related institutions. Data values 
that had not previously been reported by a bank group are denoted "--". 
Previously, the set of balance sheet items shown on the release differed 
substantially by bank group. </li>
<li>The line items on securities are now shown by issuer (Treasury and 
agency or other) and type of security (mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or 
non-MBS). Previously, securities were shown by account type (investment 
account versus trading account) for large domestically chartered 
commercial banks and foreign-related institutions, and detail on 
mortgage-backed securities was shown only for large domestically chartered 
commercial banks that held such securities in investment accounts. </li>
<li>Banks' allowance for loan and lease losses is now shown. </li>
<li>Some line items are no longer shown separately: security loans are now 
included in all other loans and leases; state and local government loans 
held in investment accounts by large banks are now included in other 
securities, non-MBS; transaction deposits are now included in deposits, 
other deposits; and nontransaction deposits are now included in deposits, 
large time deposits or in deposits, other deposits, as appropriate.</li> 
<li>Some memoranda items that were previously shown for large domestically 
chartered commercial banks have been eliminated: pass-thru mortgage-backed 
securities; CMO, REMIC, and other mortgage-backed securities. </li>
</uL> </li>
<li>The definitions of large and small domestically chartered commercial 
banks have been revised. 
<uL>
<li>Large domestically chartered commercial banks are now defined as the 
top 25 domestically chartered commercial banks, ranked by domestic assets 
as of the previous commercial bank Call Report to which the H.8 release 
data have been benchmarked. Previously, large domestically chartered 
commercial banks were defined as banks that reported the FR 2416 form 
(that form was discontinued as of July 1, 2009). </li>
<uL>
<li>If a large domestically chartered bank is acquired by a commercial 
bank or if a large bank leaves the commercial bank universe, then it is 
replaced with the bank next in line, typically the bank ranked number 26. </li>
<li>If a nonbank converts to a commercial bank charter, or if a small bank 
becomes large in size, it is not considered for the large bank panel 
(regardless of size) until the data are benchmarked to the subsequent Call 
Report. </li>
                          </uL>
<li>Small domestically chartered commercial banks are now defined as all 
domestically chartered commercial banks not included in the top 25. 
Previously, small domestically chartered commercial banks were defined as 
all domestically chartered banks that did not report the FR 2416 form. 
</li>
                        </uL>
                      </li>
<li>To the extent possible, the information available via the historical 
H.8 "Notes on the Data" link has been revised to incorporate the changes 
to the line items shown on the release. </li>

The seasonally adjusted data released on July 13, 2007--both the H.8
statistical release and the associated historical data--were based
inadvertently on a set of newly estimated seasonal factors. These
seasonal factors did not represent our final estimates and should not
have been published. <br />

                    <p>
In today's H.8 statistical release and in the associated historical
data, we have restored the previous set of seasonal factors. In
addition, we have corrected the H.8 statistical release of July 13,
2007, by restoring the previous set of seasonal factors to those data.
We will publish newly estimated seasonal factors when they have been
finalized. </p>

The original amounts of these consolidations reported for December 17 on the H.8 release dated December 29, 2003, have been revised as follows: H.8 balance sheet item 4, other securities, from $6 billion to about $7 billion, balance sheet item 6, commercial and industrial loans, from $9 billion to about $17 billion, and balance sheet item 12, other loans and leases, from $13 billion to about $47 billion. </description>

Most of these declines reflect some banks' decisions to stop consolidating their VIEs in response to the announcement by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on October 9 that it had decided to defer the implementation of its Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities from the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. For further information, please see the FASB website, <a href="http://www.fasb.org">www.fasb.org</a>. In addition, a small part of the decline reflects a restructuring of some VIEs so that they no longer need to be consolidated on bank balance sheets. <br />
                    <p>The balance sheet items affected are other securities, item 4, other loans and leases, item 12, and borrowings from others, item 24. Some of these changes extend back to July 2. Revised data for the H.8 statistical release are available on the Board's website, <a href="../default.htm">www.federalreserve.gov/releases</a>.</p>

                    <p>
Monthly estimates of total bank credit and its major components,
seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, have been extended
back from January 1973, the former start date for all the bank credit
series, to January 1947. The components that have been extended are
holdings of U.S. government securities, holdings of other securities,
and the following loan categories: commercial and industrial, real
estate, consumer, security, and "all other."</p>

<p>Data in the H.8 are for all commercial banks in the United States,
which consist of domestically chartered banks and foreign-related
institutions (mainly U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks). The
data for 1973 through 1987 report totals for all institutions as well
as subtotals for domestically chartered banks and for foreign-related
institutions; beginning in 1988, the data are further disaggregated
between large and small domestically chartered banks. The extended data
(1947-72) show only all-institution totals.</p>

<p>As with the current data, the extended monthly data are prorated
averages of Wednesday values. The weekly Wednesday data underlying the
monthly averages mix actual historical observations with estimates that
are based on linear interpolations of semimonthly, monthly, and, in a
few cases, lower-frequency observations.</p>  

<p>Several bank credit series received generally minor revisions for
the 1973-87 period when the longer time series were introduced.</p>

                    <p>Effective with this edition of the H.8 statistical release, the Federal Reserve is discontinuing the publication of the District-specific balance sheet data of large, domestically chartered banks that appeared on pages 11 through 14 of the release. </p>
<p>The reason for the change is that, with the ability of banks to establish branches virtually nationwide as of June 1, 1997, a number of large bank holding companies have converted banks located across several Federal Reserve Districts into branches of a single bank. These consolidations have significantly shifted bank balance sheet items among Federal Reserve Districts, further weakening the connection between banking data reported separately by Federal Reserve District and actual banking activities in each District. </p>
<p>However, the item coverage of the aggregate balance sheets of large banks in the H.8 has been expanded to retain the national totals of some of the items in the District tables that had not appeared in the national tables. As a result, the H.8 now reports the large bank data on four pages rather than two. <br />
