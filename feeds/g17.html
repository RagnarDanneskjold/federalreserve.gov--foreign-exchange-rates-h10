<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in June after declining 0.3 percent in May. For the second quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, its third consecutive quarterly decline. Manufacturing output moved up 0.4 percent in June, a gain largely due to an increase in motor vehicle assemblies. The output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. The index for utilities rose 2.4 percent as a result of warmer weather than is typical for June boosting demand for air conditioning. The output of mining moved up 0.2 percent for its second consecutive small monthly increase following eight straight months of decline. At 104.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in June was 0.7 percent lower than its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.5 percentage point in June to 75.4 percent, a rate that is 4.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2015 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/20160715/">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and private sources as well as updated estimates of capital spending by industry. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016, is now expected to increase 0.4 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point lower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is now expected to rise 0.7 percent, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than the previous estimate; a smaller increase in the capacity for manufacturing of selected high-technology goods accounts for the downward revision. The decrease in mining capacity for 2016 is unrevised at 3.4 percent, and the gain in capacity for utilities is also unrevised at 0.8 percent.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.4 percent in May after increasing 0.6 percent in April. Declines in the indexes for manufacturing and utilities in May were slightly offset by a small gain for mining. The output of manufacturing moved down 0.4 percent, led by a large step-down in the production of motor vehicles and parts; factory output aside from motor vehicles and parts edged down 0.1 percent. The index for utilities fell 1.0 percent, as a drop in the output of electric utilities was partly offset by a gain for natural gas utilities. After eight straight monthly declines, the production at mines moved up 0.2 percent. At 103.6 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in May was 1.4 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in May to 74.9 percent, a rate that is 5.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in April after decreasing in the previous two months. Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent after declining the same amount in March. The index for utilities jumped 5.8 percent in April, as the demand for electricity and natural gas returned to a more normal level after being suppressed by warmer-than-usual weather in March. Mining production fell 2.3 percent in April, and it has decreased more than 1 1/2 percent per month, on average, over the past eight months. At 104.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in April was 1.1 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.5 percentage point in April to 75.4 percent, a rate that is 4.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.6 percent in March for a second month in a row. For the first quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2 percent. A substantial portion of the overall decrease in March resulted from declines in the indexes for mining and utilities, which fell 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively; in addition, manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent. The sizable decrease in mining production continued the industry's recent downward trajectory; the index has fallen in each of the past seven months, at an average pace of 1.6 percent per month. At 103.4 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.5 percentage point in March to 74.8 percent, a rate that is 5.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

The index provides an estimate of year-to-year price changes for computer storage equipment assuming that the quality of the device is unchanged. Data from IDC, a company specializing in information technology industries, were used to construct a matched-model quarterly price index, which was then converted to an annual index. This annual price index was incorporated into the industrial production indexes for computer storage equipment at the time of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization that was published on April 1, 2016.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve has <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">revised</a> its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Total IP is now reported to have increased about 2 1/2 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2014 before falling 1 1/2 percent in 2015. Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change are lower, especially for 2014 and 2015. Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its pre-recession peak in November 2014, six months later than previously estimated. Capacity for total industry is now reported to have increased about 2 percent in 2014 and 2015 after having increased only 1 percent in 2013.

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.5 percent in February after increasing 0.8 percent in January. Sizable declines in the indexes for both utilities and mining in February outweighed a gain of 0.2 percent for manufacturing. The output of utilities dropped 4.0 percent, as unseasonably warm weather curbed the demand for heating. Mining production fell 1.4 percent and has decreased nearly 1.3 percent per month, on average, over the past six months. At 106.3 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in February was 1.0 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in February to 76.7 percent, a rate that is 3.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.9 percent in January after decreasing 0.7 percent in December. A storm late in the month likely held down production in January by a small amount. The index for utilities jumped 5.4 percent; demand for heating moved up markedly after having been suppressed by unseasonably warm weather in December. Manufacturing output increased 0.5 percent in January and was 1.2 percent above its year-earlier level. Mining production was unchanged following four months with declines that averaged about 1 1/2 percent per month. At 106.8 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in January was 0.7 percent below its year-earlier level.

<p>Industrial production declined 0.4 percent in December, primarily as a result of cutbacks for utilities and mining. The decrease for total industrial production in November was larger than previously reported, but upward revisions to earlier months left the level of the index in November only slightly below its initial estimate. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent. Manufacturing output edged down in December. The index for utilities dropped 2.0 percent, as continued warmer-than-usual temperatures reduced demand for heating. Mining production decreased 0.8 percent in December for its fourth consecutive monthly decline. At 106.0 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in December was 1.8 percent below its year-earlier level.

<p>Industrial production declined 0.6 percent in November after decreasing 0.4 percent in October. In November, manufacturing production was unchanged from October. The index for utilities dropped 4.3 percent, as unusually warm weather held down the demand for heating. The index for mining fell 1.1 percent in November, with much of this decrease attributable to sizable declines for coal mining and for oil and gas well drilling and servicing. At 106.5 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in November was 1.2 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector declined 0.5 percentage point in November to 77.0 percent, a rate that is 3.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve released updated microprocessor price index with new data for 2012 and 2013. This price index was previously issued in 2013 with data for 2007 through 2011. The updated price index was incorporated into the industrial production index for semiconductors and related electronic components published on July 21, 2015, as a part of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization.<br />
                    </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve also issued an annual price index for computer storage equipment for the period 2002 through 2014. The index provides an estimate of year-to-year price changes for computer storage equipment assuming that the quality of the device is unchanged. Data from IDC, a company specializing in information technology industries, were used to construct a matched-model quarterly price index, which was then converted to an annual index. This annual price index was incorporated into the industrial production indexes for computer storage equipment at the time of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization that was published on July 21, 2015.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.4 percent in August after increasing 0.9 percent in July. The increase in July is now estimated to be greater than originally reported last month, largely as a result of upward revisions for mining and utilities. Manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent in August primarily because of a large drop in motor vehicles and parts that reversed a substantial portion of its jump in July; production elsewhere in manufacturing was unchanged. The index for mining fell 0.6 percent in August, while the index for utilities rose 0.6 percent.

<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in July after moving up 0.1 percent in June. In July, manufacturing output advanced 0.8 percent primarily because of an increase in motor vehicle assemblies. The output of motor vehicles and parts jumped 10.6 percent, and production elsewhere in manufacturing edged up 0.1 percent. The index for mining rose 0.2 percent, while the index for utilities fell 1.0 percent. At 107.5 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in July was 1.3 percent above its year-earlier level.

 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2013 before advancing about 4-1/2 percent in 2014 and
 falling back somewhat in the first half of 2015.2  Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change
 are lower--especially for 2012 and 2013.  For the most recent recession, total IP still shows a
 peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent, and the dates for the peak and trough are unaltered.  However,
 the lower rates of change for recent years indicate that the recovery in the industrial sector since the
 trough has been slower than reported earlier.  Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its
 pre-recession peak in May 2014, seven months later than previously estimated

Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in June but fell at an annual rate of 1.4 percent for the second quarter of 2015. In June, manufacturing output was unchanged: The output of motor vehicles and parts fell 3.7 percent, but production elsewhere in manufacturing rose 0.3 percent. The indexes for mining and utilities advanced 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. At 105.7 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in June was 1.5 percent above its year-earlier level.

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.2 percent in May after falling 0.5 percent in April. The decline in April was larger than previously reported, but the rates of change for previous months were generally revised higher, leaving the level of the index in April slightly above its initial estimate. Manufacturing output decreased 0.2 percent in May and was little changed, on net, from its level in January. In May, the index for mining moved down 0.3 percent after declining more than 1 percent per month, on average, in the previous four months. The slower rate of decrease for mining output last month was due in part to a reduced pace of decline in the index for oil and gas well drilling and servicing. The output of utilities increased 0.2 percent in May. At 105.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 1.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.2 percentage point in May to 78.1 percent, a rate that is 2.0 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

These factors are based on production data through April 2015 and were revised back to January 1996. The seasonal factors explicitly incorporate the holiday schedule for the vehicle assembly lines. The AFL-CIO's current collective bargaining agreements with domestic manufacturers, however, expire at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Factors for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for 2016 were estimated based on the holiday schedule in place over the past three years. Once the new agreements are finalized, the seasonal factors will be updated to reflect the agreed-upon holiday schedule over the terms of the contracts.</description>

The weights for market-group splits of the indexes will be updated with information from the 2007 benchmark input-output accounts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The updated IP indexes will include revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input data) and to seasonal factors for each industry. In addition, the estimation methods for some series may be changed. Any modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present. </p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.6 percent in March after increasing 0.1 percent in February. For the first quarter of 2015 as a whole, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. The decline last quarter resulted from a drop in oil and gas well drilling and servicing of more than 60 percent at an annual rate and from a decrease in manufacturing production of 1.2 percent. In March, manufacturing output moved up 0.1 percent for its first monthly gain since November; however, factory output in January is now estimated to have fallen 0.6 percent, about twice the size of the previously reported decline. The index for mining decreased 0.7 percent in March. The output of utilities fell 5.9 percent to largely reverse a similarly sized increase in February, which was related to unseasonably cold temperatures. At 105.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent above its level of a year earlier. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.6 percentage point in March to 78.4 percent, a rate that is 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.1 percent in February after decreasing 0.3 percent in January. In February, manufacturing output moved down 0.2 percent, its third consecutive monthly decline. The rates of change for the total index in January and for manufacturing in both December and January are lower than previously reported.

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2013 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and trade sources as well as updated estimates of capital spending by industry. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014, is now expected to increase 3.1 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point faster than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 2.2 percent in 2014, a pace 0.4 percentage point less than in previous estimates; the downward revisions to capacity were widespread among manufacturing industries. The increase in mining capacity for 2014 has been revised up 3.4 percentage points to 9.2 percent, entirely as a result of an upward revision to the capacity for oil and gas extraction. The gain in capacity for utilities, at 1.0 percent, is unrevised.</p>

                      <br />Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in March after having advanced 1.2 percent in February. The rise in February was higher than previously reported primarily because of stronger gains for durable goods manufacturing and for mining. For the first quarter as a whole, industrial production moved up at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, just slightly slower than in the fourth quarter of 2013. In March, the output of manufacturing rose 0.5 percent, the output of utilities increased 1.0 percent, and the output of mines gained 1.5 percent. At 103.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 3.8 percent above its level of a year earlier.

                    <p>The Federal Reserve Board issued its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">annual revision</a> to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. The annual revision for 2014 was more limited than in recent years because the source data required to extend the annual benchmark indexes of production into 2012 were mostly unavailable. Consequently, the IP indexes published with this revision are very little changed from previous estimates. Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have increased about 3 1/3 percent in each year from 2011 to 2013. Relative to the rates of change for total IP published earlier, the new rates are 1/2 percentage point higher in 2012 and little changed in any other year. Total IP still shows a peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent for the most recent recession, and it still returned to its pre-recession peak in the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in February after having declined 0.2 percent in January. In February, manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent and nearly reversed its decline of 0.9 percent in January, which resulted, in part, from extreme weather. The gain in factory production in February was the largest since last August. The output of utilities edged down 0.2 percent following a jump of 3.8 percent in January, and the production at mines moved up 0.3 percent. At 101.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in February was 2.8 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry increased in February to 78.8 percent, a rate that is 1.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.3 percent in January after having risen 0.3 percent in December. In January, manufacturing output fell 0.8 percent, partly because of the severe weather that curtailed production in some regions of the country. Additionally, manufacturing production is now reported to have been lower in the fourth quarter; the index is now estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter rather than 6.2 percent. The output of utilities rose 4.1 percent in January, as demand for heating was boosted by unseasonably cold temperatures. The production at mines declined 0.9 percent following a gain of 1.8 percent in December. At 101.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 2.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased in January to 78.5 percent, a rate that is 1.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in November after having edged up 0.1 percent in October; output was previously reported to have declined 0.1 percent in October. The gain in November was the largest since November 2012, when production rose 1.3 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in November for its fourth consecutive monthly gain. Production at mines advanced 1.7 percent to more than reverse a decline of 1.5 percent in October. The index for utilities was up 3.9 percent in November, as colder-than-average temperatures boosted demand for heating. At 101.3 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 3.2 percent above its year-earlier level. In November, industrial production surpassed for the first time its pre-recession peak of December 2007 and was 21 percent above its trough of June 2009. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.8 percentage point in November to 79.0 percent, a rate 1.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2012) average.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board estimates seasonal factors for new light vehicle sales and provides these factors to The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for use in the National Income and Product Accounts. These factors are estimated once per year using X12-ARIMA and were last estimated in summer 2013, using vehicle sales data through April 2013. The seasonal factors for months that had not yet occurred were based on projections from the X12-ARIMA program. The factors will be revised again in summer 2014.</p>

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2013 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and trade sources as well as updated estimates of industry capital spending. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, is now expected to increase 1.8 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point slower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 1.6 percent in 2013, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than in previous estimates. Relative to the previous estimates, faster gains in the high-technology and motor vehicles industries have been more than offset by slower gains elsewhere in manufacturing. The increase in mining capacity for 2013 has been revised upward by 0.5 percentage point to 4.4 percent, while the change in capacity for utilities, at 0.9 percent, is 0.2 percentage point faster than previously estimated.</p>

Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have increased 0.7 percentage point less in 2011 than was previously published. The revisions to IP for other years were smaller: Compared to the previous estimates, industrial production fell slightly less in 2008 and 2009 and increased slightly less in 2010 and 2012. At 97.7 percent of its 2007 average, the index in the fourth quarter of 2012 now stands 0.4 percent below its previous estimate. With these revisions, IP is still estimated to have advanced about 6 percent in 2010, the first full year following the trough in June 2009 of the most recent recession, but it is now estimated to have risen about 3 percent both in 2011 and in 2012. Since the trough of the recession, total IP has reversed about 90 percent of its peak-to-trough decline.</p>

For the fourth quarter as a whole, manufacturing production is now estimated to have advanced 1.9 percent at an annual rate; previously, the increase was reported to have been 0.2 percent. In January, the output of utilities rose 3.5 percent, as demand for heating was boosted by temperatures that fell closer to their seasonal norms; the production at mines declined 1.0 percent. At 98.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 2.1 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased in January to 79.1 percent, a rate that is 1.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2012) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in November after having fallen 0.7 percent in October. The gain in November is estimated to have largely resulted from a recovery in production for industries that had been negatively affected by Hurricane Sandy, which hit the Northeast region in late October. In November, manufacturing output increased 1.1 percent after having decreased 1.0 percent in October; in addition to the storm-related rebound, a sizable rise in the production of motor vehicles and parts boosted factory output in November. The output of utilities advanced 1.0 percent, and production at mines rose 0.8 percent. At 97.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 2.5 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry increased 0.7 percentage point to 78.4 percent, a rate 1.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production declined 0.4 percent in October after having increased 0.2 percent in September. Hurricane Sandy, which held down production in the Northeast region at the end of October, is estimated to have reduced the rate of change in total output by nearly 1 percentage point. The largest estimated storm-related effects included reductions in the output of utilities, of chemicals, of food, of transportation equipment, and of computers and electronic products. In October, the index for manufacturing decreased 0.9 percent; excluding storm-related effects, factory output was roughly unchanged from September. The output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent in October, and production at mines advanced 1.5 percent. At 96.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in October was 1.7 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.8 percent, a rate 2.5 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in September after having fallen 1.4 percent in August. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent in September but moved down at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the third quarter. Production at mines advanced 0.9 percent in September, and the output of utilities moved up 1.5 percent. Roughly 0.3 percentage point of the decline in overall industrial production in August reflected the effect of precautionary idling of production in late August along the Gulf of Mexico in anticipation of Hurricane Isaac, and part of the rise in September is a result of the subsequent resumption of activity at idled facilities. At 97.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in September was 2.8 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry moved up 0.3 percentage point to 78.3 percent, a rate 2.0 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production fell 1.2 percent in August after having risen 0.5 percent in July. Hurricane Isaac restrained output in the Gulf Coast region at the end of August, reducing the rate of change in total industrial production by an estimated 0.3 percentage point. Manufacturing output decreased 0.7 percent in August after having risen 0.4 percent in both June and July. Precautionary shutdowns of oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico in advance of the hurricane contributed to a drop of 1.8 percent in the output of mines for August. The output of utilities declined 3.6 percent. At 96.8 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in August was 2.8 percent above its year-earlier level.

The largest contribution to the increase in the second quarter came from motor vehicles and parts, which climbed 18.2 percent; excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output edged up 0.1 percent. Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines advanced 0.7 percent in June, while the output of utilities decreased 1.9 percent. For the quarter, however, the output of mines fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, while the output of utilities rose 14.9 percent. At 97.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in June was 4.7 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry moved up 0.2 percentage point in June to 78.9 percent, a rate 1.4 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in March for a second month but rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012. Manufacturing output declined 0.2 percent in March but jumped 10.4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. The gain in manufacturing output in the first quarter was broadly based: Even excluding motor vehicles and parts, which jumped at an annual rate of nearly 40 percent, manufacturing output moved up at an annual rate of 8.3 percent and output for all but a few major industries increased 5 percent or more. In March, production at mines rose 0.2 percent and the output of utilities gained 1.5 percent. For the quarter, however, the output of utilities dropped at an annual rate of 13.8 percent, largely as a result of unseasonably warm temperatures over the past several months, while the output of mining fell 5.4 percent. At 96.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for March was 3.8 percent above its year-earlier level. The rate of capacity utilization for total industry edged down to 78.6 percent, a rate 2.1 percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average. </p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve Board issued its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">annual revision</a> to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) 
and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization.  Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have dropped 0.3 percentage point more in 2009; its gains in both 2010 and 2011 were essentially unchanged from what was previously 
reported.  With these minor revisions, the broad contour of total IP in recent years is similar to previous estimates.  Since the trough of the last recession in June 2009, total IP has reversed about three-fourths 
of its peak-to-trough decline.</p>
                    <p>Capacity utilization rates for recent years were revised down.  The 
revisions show that the rate of capacity utilization for total industry was 0.7 percentage point lower than previously estimated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 0.4 percentage point lower in 2011, primarily as a 
result of small upward revisions to estimates of industrial capacity. The capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was revised down 0.3 percentage point, and the rate in the final quarter of 2009 was revised down about 0.8 percentage point. </p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in January, as a gain of 0.7 percent in manufacturing was offset by declines in mining and utilities. Within manufacturing, the index for motor vehicles and parts jumped 6.8 percent and the index for other manufacturing industries increased 0.3 percent. The output of utilities fell 2.5 percent, as demand for heating was held down by temperatures that moved further above seasonal norms; the output of mines declined 1.8 percent. Total industrial production is now reported to have advanced 1.0 percent in December; the initial estimate had been an increase of 0.4 percent. This large upward revision reflected higher output for many manufacturing and mining industries. At 95.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 3.4 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased to 78.5 percent, a rate 1.8 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production expanded 0.7 percent in October after having declined 0.1 percent in September. Previously, industrial production was reported to have gained 0.2 percent in September; most of this revision resulted from lower estimated output for mining. Factory output increased 0.5 percent in October after having risen 0.3 percent in September. Production at mines climbed 2.3 percent in October, while the output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent. At 94.7 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for October was 3.9 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry stepped up to 77.8 percent, a rate 2.1 percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 2.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2010) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production advanced 0.9 percent in July. Although the index was revised down in April, primarily as a result of a downward revision to the output of utilities, stronger manufacturing output led to upward revisions to production in both May and June. Manufacturing output rose 0.6 percent in July, as the index for motor vehicles and parts jumped 5.2 percent and production elsewhere moved up 0.3 percent. The output of mines advanced 1.1 percent, and the output of utilities increased 2.8 percent, as the extreme heat during the month boosted air conditioning usage. At 94.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for July was 3.7 percentage points above its year-earlier level. The capacity utilization rate for total industry climbed to 77.5 percent, a rate 2.2 percentage points above the rate from a year earlier but 2.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2010) average. </p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in June after having edged down 0.1 percent in May. For the second quarter as a whole, total industrial production increased at an annual rate of 0.8 percent. Manufacturing output was unchanged in June. In the second quarter, supply chain disruptions following the earthquake in Japan curtailed the production of motor vehicles and parts and restrained output in related industries; the production index for overall manufacturing was little changed for the quarter. The output of mines rose 0.5 percent in June, while the output of utilities climbed 0.9 percent. At 93.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in June was 3.4 percent above its year-earlier level.

<p>Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in May, the second consecutive month with little or no gain. Revisions to total industrial production in months before May were small. In May, manufacturing production rose 0.4 percent after having fallen 0.5 percent in April. The output of motor vehicles and parts has been held down in the past two months because of supply chain disruptions following the earthquake in Japan. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output advanced 0.6 percent in May and edged down 0.1 percent in April; the decrease in April in part reflected production lost because of tornadoes in the South at the end of the month. Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines increased 0.5 percent in May, while the output of utilities fell 2.8 percent. At 93.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 3.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry was flat at 76.7 percent, a rate 3.7 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2010.</p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in April after having increased 0.7 percent in March. Output in February is now estimated to have declined 0.3 percent; previously it was reported to have edged up 0.1 percent. In April, manufacturing production fell 0.4 percent after rising for nine consecutive months. Total motor vehicle assemblies dropped from an annual rate of 9.0 million units in March to 7.9 million units in April, mainly because of parts shortages that resulted from the earthquake in Japan. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory production rose 0.2 percent in April. The output of mines advanced 0.8 percent, while the output of utilities increased 1.7 percent.

<p>Industrial production declined 0.1 percent in February after having risen 0.3 percent in January; output in January was previously estimated to have edged down 0.1 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.4 percent in February, and the gain in January was revised up to 0.9 percent. Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines rose 0.8 percent in February, which more than reversed its decline in January. However, the output of utilities fell 4.5 percent--the drop reflected unseasonably warm weather in February, which reduced the demand for heating after two months of unseasonably cold temperatures. At 95.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 5.6 percent above its year-earlier level. The capacity utilization rate for total industry edged down 0.1 percentage point to 76.3 percent, a rate 4.2 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2010.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.1 percent in January 2011 after having risen 1.2 percent in December.  In the manufacturing sector, output increased 0.3 percent in January after an upwardly revised gain of 0.9 percent in December.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory production rose 0.1 percent in January.  The output of utilities fell 1.6 percent in January, as temperatures moved closer to normal after unseasonably cold weather boosted the demand for heating in December; the output of utilities advanced 4.1 percent in that month.  In January, the output of mines declined 0.7 percent.  At 95.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 5.2 percent above its level of a year earlier.  The capacity utilization rate for total industry edged down to 76.1 percent, a rate 4.4 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2010.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.8 percent in December after having risen 0.3 percent in November. The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in November but revised up in September and October; the net effect of the revisions from July to November left the level of industrial production in November slightly higher than was previously reported. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, a slower pace than in the earlier quarters of the year. In the manufacturing sector, output moved up 0.4 percent in December with gains in both durables and nondurables. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory output increased 0.5 percent. The output of mines advanced 0.4 percent; the output of utilities surged 4.3 percent, as unusually cold weather boosted the demand for heating. At 94.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 5.9 percent above its level of a year earlier.

<p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in November after a decline of 0.2 percent in October. The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in October but up in September; the net effect of the revisions from June to October left the level of industrial production in October about the same as was previously reported. In the manufacturing sector, output advanced 0.3 percent in November with gains in both durables and nondurables. The gains among durable goods industries were particularly broad-based; only the production of motor vehicles and parts decreased substantially. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall factory output advanced 0.7 percent. The output of mines edged lower, but the output of utilities moved up 1.9 percent as the return of more seasonal temperatures boosted the demand for heating. At 93.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 5.4 percent above its level a year earlier.

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in October after having fallen 0.2 percent in September.  For the manufacturing sector, output gained 0.5 percent in October after having risen 0.1 percent in September.
 Factory production in September was initially reported to have decreased 0.2 percent, but incoming data on
 steel, fabricated metal products, machinery, and chemicals helped boost the index.  The output of utilities
 dropped 3.4 percent in October, as unseasonably warm temperatures reduced demand for heating.  Production at mines fell 0.1 percent.  At 93.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in October was 5.3 percent above its year-earlier level.  The capacity utilization rate for total industry was flat at 74.8 percent, a rate 6.6 percentage points above the low in June 2009 and 5.8 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.</p>

Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to decrease 0.8 percent this year after having declined 0.9 percent in 2009.  Manufacturing capacity is estimated to decline 1.0 percent in 2010 following a decrease of 1.2 percent last year.  Mining capacity is estimated to move up 0.3 percent in 2010 after having declined 0.7 percent in 2009, and utilities capacity is projected to expand 2.1 percent this year, which is 0.3 percentage point faster than it had last year.  These estimates will be updated with the publication in late June 2010 of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization.<br />

Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to decrease 0.3 percent this year after having expanded 1.5 percent in 2008. Manufacturing capacity is estimated to decline 0.6 percent in 2009 after having risen 1.7 percent last year. In 2009, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.8 percent, about the same as in 2008, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.7 percent, which is 0.5 percentage point slower than it had last year. With the publication on March 27, 2009, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Plant Capacity for the fourth quarter of 2008, which covers manufacturing.<br />

                      <strong>February 15, 2008:</strong> The data in this release include preliminary estimates of industrial capacity for 2008. Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to rise 1.9 percent this year after having expanded 1.8 percent in 2007. Manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase 2.1 percent in 2008, the same amount as in 2007. In 2008, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.7 percent, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.9 percent; both rates of increase would be slightly faster than for last year. With the publication on March 28, 2008, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the 2006 Survey of Plant Capacity, physical capacity data from government and trade sources, and the revised production indexes.</p>
