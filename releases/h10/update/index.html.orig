<PRE> Effective January 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board is discontinuing publication of the H.10 Daily Update, 
 which provides U.S. dollar exchange rates against other currencies certified for customs purposes by the 
 Federal Reserve Bank of New York and summary measures of the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also has <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/markets/2007/fx071002.html">issued notification</a> that it will discontinue publication 
 of these foreign exchange rates on its web site.  

 The Federal Reserve Board will still make the certified exchange rates available.  Effective January 5, 2009,
 the Board will publish the daily exchange rate data in a weekly version of the H.10 release, reinstituting the
 weekly publication, which had been discontinued in May 2006.  The webpage that links to historical data from 
 the H.10 release will also be updated once per week to pick up the daily data from the previous week.

 For more information on exchange rate indexes for the U.S. dollar, see "Indexes of the Foreign
 Exchange Value of the Dollar," Federal Reserve Bulletin, 91:1 (Winter 2005), pp. 1-8
 (http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2005/winter05_index.pdf). Weights for the broad index
 can be found at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H10/Weights; weights for the major currencies
 index and the other important trading partners (OITP) index are derived from the broad index
 weights. The most recent annual revision of the currency weights and dollar indexes took effect
 with the January 2, 2007 release of this report.
 The source for exchange rates not listed in the table above but used in the calculation of the
 broad and OITP indexes is Bloomberg L.P.

 *  U.S. dollars per currency unit.
 1) A weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies
 of a broad group of major U.S. trading partners.
 2) A weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against a subset of
 the broad index currencies that circulate widely outside the country of issue.
 3) A weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against a subset of
 the broad index currencies that do not circulate widely outside the country of issue.

 The euro is reported in place of the individual euro-area currencies. These currency rates can
 be derived from the dollar/euro rate by using the fixed conversion rates (in currencies per euro)
 given below:
