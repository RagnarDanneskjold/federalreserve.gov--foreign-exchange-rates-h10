<p>Reserve requirements are the amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Within limits specified by law, the Board of Governors has sole authority over changes in reserve requirements. Depository institutions must hold reserves in the form of vault cash or deposits with Federal Reserve Banks.</p>

<p>The dollar amount of a depository institution's reserve requirement is determined by applying the reserve ratios specified in the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D to an institution's reservable liabilities (see table of <a href="reservereq.htm#table1">reserve requirements</a>). <a id="text1" name="text1"> </a>Reservable liabilities consist of net transaction accounts, nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities. Since December 27, 1990, nonpersonal time deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities have had a reserve ratio of zero.</p>

<p>The reserve ratio on net transactions accounts depends on the amount of net transactions accounts at the depository institution. The Garn-St Germain Act of 1982 exempted the first $2 million of reservable liabilities from reserve requirements. This "exemption amount" is adjusted each year according to a formula specified by the act. The amount of net transaction accounts subject to a reserve requirement ratio of 3 percent was set under the Monetary Control Act of 1980 at $25 million. This "low reserve tranche" is also adjusted each year (see table of <a href="reservereq.htm#table2">low reserve tranche amounts and exemption amounts since 1982</a>). <a id="text2" name="text2"> </a>Net transaction accounts in excess of the low reserve tranche are currently reservable at 10 percent.</p>

<p>For more history on the changes in reserve requirement ratios and the indexation of the exemption and low reserve tranche, see the <a href="reservereq.htm#table3">annual review</a> table. Additional details on reserve requirements can be found in the <em><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq-reserve-maintenance-manual.htm" target="_self">Reserve Maintenance Manual</a> </em>and in the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/0693lead.pdf">article (119 KB PDF)</a> in the <em>Federal Reserve Bulletin</em>, the appendix of which has tables of historical reserve ratios.</p>

<p class="footnotes">Notes: Reserve requirements must be satisfied by holding vault cash and, if vault cash is insufficient, also&nbsp;by a deposit maintained with a Federal Reserve Bank. An institution&nbsp;may hold&nbsp;that deposit directly with a Reserve Bank or with another institution in a pass-through relationship. Reserve requirements are imposed on "depository institutions," defined as&nbsp;commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, Edge corporations, and agreement corporations.</p>

Net transaction accounts are total transaction accounts less amounts due from other depository institutions and less cash items in the process of collection.
