Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016, is now expected to increase 0.4 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point lower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is now expected to rise 0.7 percent, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than the previous estimate; a smaller increase in the capacity for manufacturing of selected high-technology goods accounts for the downward revision.

For the first quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2 percent. A substantial portion of the overall decrease in March resulted from declines in the indexes for mining and utilities, which fell 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively; in addition, manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent. The sizable decrease in mining production continued the industry's recent downward trajectory; the index has fallen in each of the past seven months, at an average pace of 1.6 percent per month. At 103.4 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.5 percentage point in March to 74.8 percent, a rate that is 5.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>]]></description><dc:date>2016-04-15T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Data for March 2016 are now available</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-04-15T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1360"><title>G17: Computer Storage Equipment Price Index Released</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1360</link><description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve updated its <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/ComputerStoragePriceIndex.htm">computer storage equipment price index</a> with new data for 2015.

Total IP is now reported to have increased about 2 1/2 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2014 before falling 1 1/2 percent in 2015. Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change are lower, especially for 2014 and 2015. Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its pre-recession peak in November 2014, six months later than previously estimated. Capacity for total industry is now reported to have increased about 2 percent in 2014 and 2015 after having increased only 1 percent in 2013. Compared with the previously reported estimates, the gain in 2015 is 1/2 percentage point higher, and the gain in 2013 is 1/2 percentage point lower. Industrial capacity is expected to increase 1/2 percent in 2016.</description><dc:date>2016-04-01T12:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision Released</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-04-01T12:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1331"><title>G17: Seasonal Factors for auto and truck production have been revised</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1331</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm">Seasonal factors for auto and truck production</a> have been revised from January 1996 through October 2017.

More information, including additional detail on the calculation methodology, will also be published March 2.For additional information, please see:Statement Regarding the Implementation of Planned Changes to the Effective Federal Funds Rate and Publication of the Overnight Bank Funding RateStatement Regarding Planned Changes to the Calculation of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Publication of an Overnight Bank Funding Rate Statement Regarding the Calculation Methodology for the Effective Federal Funds Rate and Overnight Bank Funding Rate </description><dc:date>2016-02-01T14:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Implementation of Planned Changes to the Effective Federal Funds Rate</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-02-01T14:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1217"><title>H6: MONEY STOCK REVISIONS</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1217</link><description>The Federal Reserve revised its measures of the money stock and their components to incorporate updated seasonal factors and a new quarterly benchmark.   This release includes seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components produced with revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2015 and estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure.[1] While the updated seasonal factors resulted in revisions to the growth rates of seasonally adjusted M2 for individual months in 2015, the growth rates for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first and second half of 2015 were roughly unchanged.  This release also includes a new quarterly benchmark, which incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters.[2]   These revisions to deposit data start in 2012.  In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2015.  Likewise, the benchmark incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 2015.  This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. The effects of both the revisions to seasonal factors and the new quarterly benchmark on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/statisticsdata.htm.--------------------[1] Information on the seasonal adjustment procedure is available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as.[2] "Call Reports" refers to the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031 and 041; OMB No. 7100-0036) and the credit union Statement of Financial Condition (NCUA 5300/5300SF; OMB No. 3133-0004).</description><dc:date>2016-01-28T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>MONEY STOCK REVISIONS</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2016-01-28T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H6</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1220"><title>CP: Revisions to Commercial Paper Outstanding</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1220</link><description>On January 28, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board released revisions to the values of seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding levels based on updated issuer information.

The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST), which was enacted on December 4, 2015, requires that aggregate Federal Reserve Bank surplus not exceed $10 billion.  Therefore, any amount of aggregate Reserve Bank surplus that exceeds this limit will be remitted to the U.S. Treasury.  The line "Interest on Federal Reserve Notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 6 has been replaced with "Earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury" and footnotes to tables 1, 5, and 6 have been similarly modified.  The amounts of the line items "Other liabilities and capital" on table 1, and "Surplus" on tables 5 and 6 reflect the payment of approximately $19.3 billion to Treasury on December 28, 2015, which was necessary to reduce aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to the $10 billion limitation in the FAST Act.</description><dc:date>2015-12-31T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Change to H.4.1 to reflect the passage of the FAST Act</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2015-12-31T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1189"><title>H15: Correction to Aaa and Baa corporate bond data for December 24 and the week ending December 25, 2015</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1189</link><description>The weekly H.15 release issued on Monday, December 28 2015, has been corrected.

This price index was previously issued in 2013 with data for 2007 through 2011. The updated price index was incorporated into the industrial production index for semiconductors and related electronic components published on July 21, 2015, as a part of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization.
The Federal Reserve also issued an annual price index for computer storage equipment for the period 2002 through 2014. The index provides an estimate of year-to-year price changes for computer storage equipment assuming that the quality of the device is unchanged. Data from IDC, a company specializing in information technology industries, were used to construct a matched-model quarterly price index, which was then converted to an annual index. This annual price index was incorporated into the industrial production indexes for computer storage equipment at the time of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization that was published on July 21, 2015.</description><dc:date>2015-12-16T09:15:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Microprocessor Price Index and Computer Storage Equipment Price Index Released</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2015-12-16T09:15:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1152"><title>Z1: Z.1 release: 2015:Q3 data now available for the Financial Accounts of the United States</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#1152</link><description>This release incorporates numerous revisions, structural changes, and enhancements.

 capacity and capacity utilization.1  Total IP is now reported to have increased slightly less than 2-1/2
 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2013 before advancing about 4-1/2 percent in 2014 and
 falling back somewhat in the first half of 2015.2  Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change
 are lower--especially for 2012 and 2013.  For the most recent recession, total IP still shows a
 peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent, and the dates for the peak and trough are unaltered.  However,
 the lower rates of change for recent years indicate that the recovery in the industrial sector since the
 trough has been slower than reported earlier.  Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its
 pre-recession peak in May 2014, seven months later than previously estimated

The indexes for mining and utilities advanced 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. At 105.7 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in June was 1.5 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.2 percentage point in June to 78.4 percent, a rate that is 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</description><dc:date>2015-07-15T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Data for June 2015 are now available</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2015-07-15T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#946"><title>G19: Revisions of G.19 - Consumer Credit for July 8, 2015</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#946</link><description>The May commercial bank interest rate numbers were inadvertently omitted from the G.19 statistical release of consumer credit posted on July 8th.

The decline in April was larger than previously reported, but the rates of change for previous months were generally revised higher, leaving the level of the index in April slightly above its initial estimate.

In May, the index for mining moved down 0.3 percent after declining more than 1 percent per month, on average, in the previous four months. The slower rate of decrease for mining output last month was due in part to a reduced pace of decline in the index for oil and gas well drilling and servicing.

The output of utilities fell 1.3 percent in April. At 105.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in April was 1.9 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in April to 78.2 percent, a rate that is 1.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>]]></description><dc:date>2015-05-15T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Data for April 2015 are now available</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2015-05-15T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#925"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision 2015 Publication Date</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#925</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity utilization on July 21, 2015.  New annual benchmark data for 2012 and 2013 for manufacturing will be incorporated, as well as other annual data, including information on the mining of metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels). The weights for market-group splits of the indexes will be updated with information from the 2007 benchmark input-output accounts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The updated IP indexes will include revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input data) and to seasonal factors for each industry. In addition, the estimation methods for some series may be changed. Any modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present.</description><dc:date>2015-05-15T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision 2015 Publication Date</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2015-05-15T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#922"><title>G19: Upcoming changes to the May 7th Consumer Credit (G.19) release</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#922</link><description>Starting on May 7th, 2015, publication of finance company auto loan terms of credit series will resume using a new source.

For the first quarter of 2015 as a whole, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. The decline last quarter resulted from a drop in oil and gas well drilling and servicing of more than 60 percent at an annual rate and from a decrease in manufacturing production of 1.2 percent. In March, manufacturing output moved up 0.1 percent for its first monthly gain since November; however, factory output in January is now estimated to have fallen 0.6 percent, about twice the size of the previously reported decline. The index for mining decreased 0.7 percent in March. The output of utilities fell 5.9 percent to largely reverse a similarly sized increase in February, which was related to unseasonably cold temperatures. At 105.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent above its level of a year earlier.

This release includes seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components produced with revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2014 and estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure.[1]  The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2014 and a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half.This release also includes a new quarterly benchmark, which incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters.[2]  These revisions to deposit data start in 2013.  In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2014.  Likewise, the benchmark incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 1996.  This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data.The effects of both the revisions to seasonal factors and the new quarterly benchmark on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7.Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases.---------[1]  Information on the X-12-ARIMA procedure is available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a.

The annual revision for 2014 was more limited than in recent years because the source data required to extend the annual benchmark indexes of production into 2012 were mostly unavailable. Consequently, the IP indexes published with this revision are very little changed from previous estimates. Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have increased about 3 1/3 percent in each year from 2011 to 2013. Relative to the rates of change for total IP published earlier, the new rates are 1/2 percentage point higher in 2012 and little changed in any other year. Total IP still shows a peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent for the most recent recession, and it still returned to its pre-recession peak in the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>]]></description><dc:date>2014-03-28T12:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision Released</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2014-03-28T12:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#781"><title>G17: G.17 Data for February 2014 are now available</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#781</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">February 2014</a> are now available.</p><p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in February after having declined 0.2 percent in January.

The second new statistic is the Consumer DSR, defined as the total quarterly required consumer debt payments divided by total quarterly disposable personal income. The DSR is the sum of the Mortgage DSR and the Consumer DSR. Most users should find the new DSR components more useful analytically than the former FOR components.

Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 1.6 percent in 2013, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than in previous estimates. Relative to the previous estimates, faster gains in the high-technology and motor vehicles industries have been more than offset by slower gains elsewhere in manufacturing.

The amounts shown in table 1 of this release as "Unamortized premiums on securities held outright" and "Foreign currency denominated assets" were previously included as components of "Other Federal Reserve assets."  The footnote accompanying "Other Federal Reserve assets" in table 1 has been updated to identify the remaining major components, which include accrued interest, other accounts receivable, and bank premises.  The amount shown in table 1 of this release as "Unamortized discounts on securities held outright" was previously included as a component of "Other liabilities and capital." The release also reflects this additional detail on tables 8 and 9.

For more details on the survey and the revisions, see the documentation posted to the G.19 Consumer Credit revisions page on September 10, 2012, at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/revisions/.</description><dc:date>2013-03-21T11:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Revisions to finance company Assets and Liabilities estimates released</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2013-03-21T11:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G20</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#634"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#634</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue an annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity utilization on March 22, 2013, at 12:00 noon EDT.</description><dc:date>2013-03-15T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2013-03-15T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#635"><title>G17: G.17 Data for February 2013 are now available</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#635</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">February 2013</a> are now available.</p><p>Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in February after having been unchanged in January.

This release includes revised monthly and weekly seasonal factors as well as comparisons of the revised monetary aggregates with previously published data. The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2012 and a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half.The benchmark incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters. These revisions to deposit data start in 2011. In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2011. The benchmark also incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 2007. This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. Seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components incorporate revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2012. Monthly seasonal factors were estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure. The effects of both the new benchmark and the revisions to seasonal factors on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases. </description><dc:date>2013-01-17T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Money Stock Revisions</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2013-01-17T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H6</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#616"><title>G17: G.17 Data for December 2012 are now available</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#616</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">December 2012</a> are now available.</p><p>Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in December after having risen 1.0 percent in November when production rebounded in the industries that had been negatively affected by Hurricane Sandy in late October.

Effective with this release (for data collected for the week of November 5-12), the number of banks that is reporting the new items is sufficient to calculate meaningful summary statistics for those responses. Several changes, summarized below, have been made to the E.2 release. 

The minimum loan size reported on the survey is now $10,000, an increase from the previous minimum loan size of $7,500. This new minimum is reflected on all tables of the E.2 release.
Loans guaranteed, either in part or in whole, by the Small Business Association (SBA) are now identified. The percent of loans backed by the SBA are now shown on tables 1-6. A new table summarizing the terms of loans backed by the SBA has been added (table 7).
Loans made under syndication or participation are now identified. The percent of loans made under these arrangements are now shown on tables 1-6. A new table summarizing the terms of loans made under participation or syndication has been added (table 8). 
In addition to these changes, the time series from the aggregate data reported on the E.2 release will be available for customizable download through the Federal Reserve Board's Data Download Program (DDP) in late January. These data will be updated quarterly with the E.2 release. Finally, we will no longer provide a PDF of the E.2 release.</description><dc:date>2012-12-21T10:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Changes to Items Report on the Release for December, 2012</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-12-21T10:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>E2</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#608"><title>G17: Communications Equipment Price Indexes Released</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#608</link><description>Quarterly price indexes for communications equipment have been re-estimated using product data through Q3 2012.

ESTNovember 29, 2012SPECIAL NOTICEData on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January 2011. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.[1] The maximum revision to total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any maintenance period was $956 million; most revisions were less than $500 million. A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and seasonal factors is available under "Annual review of break and seasonal factors" on the Federal Reserve's website. Historical data, updated each week, are available from the Data Download Program website.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at each depository institution.  Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions.  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the low-reserve tranche is $71.0 million, rising to $79.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.  Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from reserve requirements.  Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30).  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the reserve requirement exemption is $11.5 million, rising to $12.4 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.</description><dc:date>2012-11-29T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Annual Review of Break and Seasonal Factors for Reserves and the Monetary Base</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-11-29T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H3</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#595"><title>CP: Additional Information on the Commercial Paper Release</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#595</link><description>Additional information added to the Rate Calculations section of the About page of the Commercial Paper release.

The largest estimated storm-related effects included reductions in the output of utilities, of chemicals, of food, of transportation equipment, and of computers and electronic products. In October, the index for manufacturing decreased 0.9 percent; excluding storm-related effects, factory output was roughly unchanged from September. The output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent in October, and production at mines advanced 1.5 percent.

The revised data will be made available in the April report, which will be released in the next several days. The new flow data represent changes in the level of receivables due to economic and financial activity, rather than breaks in the data series due to changes in methodology, source data, and other technical aspects of the estimation that affect the level of receivables. Access to flow data allows users to calculate a growth rate for finance company receivables that excludes such breaks. These changes will be accompanied by revisions to the estimates of receivables outstanding back to January 2006 and reflect improvements in methodology and a comprehensive review of the source data.

For the quarter, however, the output of utilities dropped at an annual rate of 13.8 percent, largely as a result of unseasonably warm temperatures over the past several months, while the output of mining fell 5.4 percent. At 96.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for March was 3.8 percent above its year-earlier level. The rate of capacity utilization for total industry edged down to 78.6 percent, a rate 2.1 percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>]]></description><dc:date>2012-04-17T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Data for March 2012 are now available</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-04-17T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#513"><title>CP: Revisions to Commercial Paper Outstanding</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#513</link><description>On April 12, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board released revisions to the

Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have dropped 0.3 percentage point more in 2009; its gains in both 2010 and 2011 were essentially unchanged from what was previously reported.  With these minor revisions, the broad contour of total IP in recent years is similar to previous estimates.  Since the trough of the last recession in June 2009, total IP has reversed about three-fourths of its peak-to-trough decline.</p><p>Capacity utilization rates for recent years were revised down.  The 
revisions show that the rate of capacity utilization for total industry was 0.7 percentage point lower than previously estimated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 0.4 percentage point lower in 2011, primarily as a result of small upward revisions to estimates of industrial capacity. The capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was revised down 0.3 percentage point, and the rate in the final quarter of 2009 was revised down about 0.8 percentage point. </p>]]></description><dc:date>2012-03-30T12:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-03-30T12:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#511"><title>G17: Seasonal Factors for auto and truck production have been reestimated</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#511</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm">Seasonal factors for auto and truck production</a> have been reestimated using final production data through February 2012 and manufacturers' assembly plans through June 2012; they also reflect the holiday schedule in place from the new domestic autoworkers' agreement signed in the 3rd quarter of 2011.

capacity is estimated to advance 0.9 percent in 2012 after having gained
 0.8 percent in 2011.  Mining capacity is estimated to rise 1.1 percent 
in 2012 after having moved up 2.1 percent in 2011, and capacity at 
electric and natural gas utilities is projected to expand 2.4 percent 
this year, which is 0.4 percentage point faster than the increase 
recorded last year.  These estimates will be updated with the 
publication on March 30, 2012, of the annual revision to industrial

This release includes revised monthly and weekly seasonal factors as well as comparisons of the revised monetary aggregates with previously published data. The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2011 and a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half. The benchmark incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the weekly and quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters. These revisions to deposit data start in 2002. In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2006. The benchmark also incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 1996. This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. Seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components incorporate revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2011. Monthly seasonal factors were estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure. The effects of both the new benchmark and the revisions to seasonal factors on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases. </description><dc:date>2012-01-19T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Money Stock Revisions</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2012-01-19T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H6</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#483"><title>G17: G.17 Data for December 2011 are now available</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#483</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">December 2011</a> are now available.</p><p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in December after having fallen 0.3 percent in November.

EDT October 27, 2011 SPECIAL NOTICE Data on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January 2010. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.1 The maximum revision to total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any maintenance period was $2.0 billion; most revisions were less than $700 million. A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and seasonal factors is available under "Annual review of break and seasonal factors" on the Federal Reserve's website (http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/hist/). Historical data, updated each week, are available there as well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at each depository institution. Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions. For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2011, the low-reserve tranche is $58.8 million, rising to $71.0 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from reserve requirements. Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30). For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2011, the reserve requirement exemption is $10.7 million, rising to $11.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. </description><dc:date>2011-10-27T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Annual Review of Break and Seasonal Factors for Reserves and the Monetary Base</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2011-10-27T16:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H3</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#458"><title>H41: Revaluation of the net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLCs and the TALF fair value adjustment </title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#458</link><description>For release at 4:30 P.M.

On September 18, 2008, a set of securities lent under the TSLF was returned to the Federal Reserve, but the return of these securities was not reflected in the reported value for the TSLF until September 24, 2008.  As a result, corrections to table 1A, Memorandum Items, have been made to reflect the earlier return of these securities on September 18, 2008.  Under the TSLF, the Federal Reserve maintained ownership of securities lent, and the lending of securities did not directly affect the Federal Reserve's assets and liabilities. In table 1A, the weekly average value of the "Term facility" for the week ended Wednesday, September 24, 2008, was corrected from $185,636 million to $174,045 million.  Also in table 1A, the weekly average value of "Securities lent to dealers" for the week ended Wednesday, September 24, 2008, was corrected from $204,948 million to $193,357 million.  </description><dc:date>2011-06-30T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Correction to the average amount outstanding of securities lent under the Term Securities Lending Facility for the week ending September 24, 2008</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2011-06-30T16:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#410"><title>G17: Seasonal Factors for auto and truck production have been reestimated</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#410</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/mvsf.htm">Seasonal factors for auto and truck production</a> have been reestimated using final production data through April 2011 and manufacturers' assembly plans through September 2011.

Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines rose 0.8 percent in February, which more than reversed its decline in January. However, the output of utilities fell 4.5 percent--the drop reflected unseasonably warm weather in February, which reduced the demand for heating after two months of unseasonably cold temperatures. At 95.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 5.6 percent above its year-earlier level.

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," reflects the closing of the American International Group, Inc. (AIG) recapitalization plan, which occurred on January 14, 2011.  The recapitalization plan was designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Federal Reserve.  Upon closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, specifically the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), were used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan), including accrued interest and fees, and then to redeem a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  The remaining FRBNY preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC and AIA Aurora LLC, valued at approximately $20 billion, were purchased by AIG through a draw on the Treasury's Series F preferred stock commitment and then transferred by AIG to the Treasury as consideration for the draw on the available Series F funds.  The weekly average values shown in table 1 reflect, as of January 14, 2011, the repayment by AIG of the "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net" and the "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and the distribution of the "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent." The H.4.1 statistical release continues to show average amounts for "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net," "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent," even though all funding commitments to AIG have been terminated, to provide a complete disaggregation of changes in assets and liabilities from the corresponding week one year ago.</description><dc:date>2011-01-20T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Closing of the American International Group, Inc.

The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in November but revised up in September and October; the net effect of the revisions from July to November left the level of industrial production in November slightly higher than was previously reported.  For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, a slower pace than in the earlier quarters of the year.  In the manufacturing sector, output moved up 0.4 percent in December with gains in both durables and nondurables.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory output increased 0.5 percent.  The output of mines advanced 0.4 percent; the output of utilities surged 4.3 percent, as unusually cold weather boosted the demand for heating.

Eastern timeJanuary 6, 2011
 
The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to reflect an accounting policy change that will result in a more transparent presentation of each Federal Reserve Bank's capital accounts and distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Although the accounting policy change does not affect the amount of residual earnings that the Federal Reserve Banks distribute to the U.S. Treasury, it may affect the timing of the distributions.  Consistent with long-standing policy of the Board of Governors, the residual earnings of each Federal Reserve Bank, after providing for the costs of operations, payment of dividends, and the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in, are distributed weekly to the U.S. Treasury.  The distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is made in accordance with the Board of Governor's authority to levy an interest charge on the Federal Reserve Banks based on the amount of each Federal Reserve Bank's outstanding Federal Reserve notes.  
Effective January 1, 2011, as a result of the accounting policy change, on a daily basis each Federal Reserve Bank will adjust the balance in its surplus account to equate surplus with capital paid-in and, in addition, will adjust its liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Previously these adjustments were made only at year-end.  Adjusting the surplus account balance and the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is consistent with the existing requirement for daily accrual of many other items that appear in the Board's H.4.1 statistical release.  The liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury will be reported as "Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 10.  Previously, the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in and the amount of the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury were included in "Other capital accounts" in table 9 and in "Other capital" in table 10.</description><dc:date>2011-01-06T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Change in Presentation of Reserve Bank Remittances to the U.S. Treasury</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2011-01-06T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#348"><title>G20: DDP data for Finance Companies are incomplete</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#348</link><description>Data in the Data Download Program (DDP) for the December 21, 2010 release of Finance Companies (G.20) are currently incomplete.

<p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in November after a decline of 0.2 percent in October.  The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in October but up in September; the net effect of the revisions from June to October left the level of industrial production in October about the same as was previously reported.  In the manufacturing sector, output advanced 0.3 percent in November with gains in both durables and nondurables.  The gains among durable goods industries were particularly broad-based; only the production of motor vehicles and parts decreased substantially. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall factory output advanced 0.7 percent.  The output of mines edged lower, but the output of utilities moved up 1.9 percent as the return of more seasonal temperatures boosted the demand for heating.  At 93.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 5.4 percent above its level a year earlier.  The capacity utilization rate for total industry rose to 75.2 percent, a rate 5.4 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.</p>]]></description><dc:date>2010-12-15T09:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2011-01-13T18:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Data for November 2010 are now available</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2010-12-15T09:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#342"><title>H41: Revaluation of the TALF fair value adjustment</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#342</link><description>For release at4:30 p.m. ESTDecember 2, 2010

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to report the funds held as agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) related to the recapitalization plan announced by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) on September 30, 2010.  The recapitalization plan, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2011, is designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY.  Pending the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain AIG asset dispositions will be held by the FRBNY as agent.  
At the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, most notably the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), will be used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan) and then to retire a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC (preferred interests) taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  Alternatively, if the recapitalization plan is terminated under the terms of the plan, then the proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA and the sale of ALICO will be used to redeem the preferred interests in accordance with the AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC limited liability company agreements, and any excess proceeds from these transactions, as well as proceeds from the disposition of other assets, will be used to repay the AIG loan.  
The FRBNY began to hold as agent funds from the cash proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA on October 29, 2010, and from the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO on November 1, 2010.  
The funds held by the FRBNY as agent from the disposition of the AIG assets are reported in table 1 and are included in "Other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.</description><dc:date>2010-11-04T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Release modification to report the funds held as agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) related to the recapitalization plan announced by American International Group, Inc.

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to reflect the recent expansion of the set of counterparties with whom the Federal Reserve might conduct reverse repurchase agreements for the purposes of open market operations. (See http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/rrp_counterparties.html). As a result of this expansion, the line "Dealers" under the heading "Reverse repurchase agreements" will be replaced with "Others" in table 1.

These distributions will also result in a corresponding reduction of the net portfolio holdings of the LLC.</description><dc:date>2010-07-22T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Maiden Lane LLC began making distributions to repay its loan extended by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY)</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2010-07-22T16:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#295"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#295</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board issued its annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization.

Eastern time June 24, 2010 
The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information on term deposits held by depository institutions.  Term deposits are a new tool that the Federal Reserve could use to manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions.  
On May 28, 2010, the Federal Reserve announced a schedule for three small-value auctions of term deposits to be offered through its Term Deposit Facility (TDF).  These auctions are intended to ensure the effective operation of the TDF and to help eligible institutions become familiar with the term deposit program.  The first auction was conducted on June 14, 2010, and settlement occurred on June 17, 2010.  The small-value TDF auctions are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy. 
Information on the amount of term deposits outstanding is presented on table 1, table 10, and table 11.  The maturity distribution of term deposits is presented in table 2.</description><dc:date>2010-06-24T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Information on the amount of term deposits outstanding is presented on the H.4.1 release</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2010-06-24T16:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#290"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#290</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue an annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization on June 25, 2010, at 12:00 p.m.</description><dc:date>2010-06-21T12:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2010-06-21T12:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#289"><title>Z1: Correction to June 10, 2010, Z.1 DDP data</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#289</link><description>The Z.1 DDP data has been re-posted to correct missing annual data prior to 1960 and quarterly data prior to 1992q1.

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to report the maturity distribution of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities (central bank liquidity swaps).  These facilities were re-established in response to the re-emergence of strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets in Europe and are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers.
The maturity distribution of these swaps is reported again in table 2.  The release continues to show the outstanding dollar value of central bank liquidity swaps in tables 1, 10, and 11.  
Detailed information about draws on the swap lines by the participating central banks is presented on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website: http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/liquidity_swap.html.</description><dc:date>2010-05-13T16:30:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Re-establishment of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2010-05-13T16:30:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#273"><title>H10: Foreign exchange rate data are now available through interactive Data Download Program</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#273</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that data from its G.5 and H.10 statistical releases, "Foreign Exchange Rates," are now available through the Data Download Program.

(AIG).  In addition, the release has been modified to incorporate fair value adjustments associated with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  
Consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the AIG revolving credit extension has been reduced by a revision of $1,255 million to the loan restructuring adjustment.  The restructuring adjustment is related to the loan modification that eliminated the floor on the Libor rate, announced on March 2, 2009, and that was first incorporated in reported figures beginning with the July 30, 2009, H.4.1 release.  The restructuring adjustment recognizes the economic effect of the reduced interest rate on the revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit extension. The revised restructuring adjustment incorporates quarterly updates as of December 31, 2009, of estimates of factors such as interest rates and future cash flow streams that are used to value the original loan restructuring adjustment.  The Federal Reserve expects that the credit extension, including interest and commitment fees under the modified terms, will be fully repaid.
The weekly average balance of the credit extended to AIG shown in table 1 reflects holdings from March 25, 2010, through Wednesday, March 31, 2010.*  The balance for the first six days of this reporting week reflects the loan restructuring adjustment prior to its revision.  The balance for the final day of the reporting week reflects the revised loan restructuring adjustment.  
Several items on the release have been modified to include fair value adjustments associated with the TALF.  A fair value adjustment to the TALF loans extended by FRBNY is recorded in "Other Federal Reserve assets" in table 1 and "Other assets" in table 10 and in table 11.  This fair value adjustment of $557 million reflects the value of the future interest received by FRBNY that is paid to the TALF LLC to provide credit protection.  The adjustment is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the fair value of the liability to the U.S. Treasury related to its beneficial interest in the TALF LLC recorded in "Other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and "Other liabilities" in table 10 and in table 11.  The fair value adjustments associated with the TALF will be updated quarterly.

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information related to TALF LLC, a limited liability company formed to purchase and manage any asset-backed securities that might be received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) in connection with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  This information will be presented in a new table 8, "Information on Principal Accounts of TALF LLC."  The release has also been modified to include information related to the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC.  This information is presented in table 1, in table 8, in table 9, and in table 10.
On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the TALF under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  Under the TALF, the FRBNY extends loans to eligible borrowers to finance the purchase of eligible asset-backed securities (ABS) that serve as the collateral for the loans.  The loans provided through the TALF are non-recourse, meaning that the obligation of the borrower can be discharged by surrendering the collateral to the FRBNY.  The loans are extended for the market value of the security less an amount known as a haircut.  As a result, the borrower bears the initial risk of a decline in the value of the security.  TALF LLC has committed, for a fee, to purchase all ABS received by FRBNY in conjunction with a TALF loan at a price equal to the TALF loan plus accrued but unpaid interest.  Purchases of these securities are funded first through the fees received by the LLC and any interest the LLC has earned on its investments.  In the event that such funding proves insufficient, the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) will provide additional subordinated debt funding to the TALF LLC to finance up to $20 billion of asset purchases.  Subsequently, the FRBNY will finance any additional purchases of securities by providing senior debt funding to TALF LLC.  Thus, the TARP funds provide credit protection to FRBNY.
The Federal Reserve has completed its evaluation and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of TALF LLC will be consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the FRBNY in the preparation of the statements of condition shown on the release. Although the U.S. Treasury provides credit protection to the FRBNY, the FRBNY is the more closely associated beneficiary of the LLC because it directs the significant financial activities of the TALF LLC. 
The consequences of this consolidation appear on the release in the following ways.  Any extensions of credit from the FRBNY to TALF LLC are eliminated, as is the accrued interest on such loans.  The net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC are included in "total factors supplying reserve funds" in table 1 and in "assets" in table 9 and in table 10.  The liabilities of TALF LLC to entities other than the FRBNY are included in "other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and in "other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.Information on the principal accounts of TALF LLC is presented separately in a new table 8.  This table presents the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC, which comprise the fair value of the ABS holdings of TALF LLC and other investments that result from the initial funding provided by the U.S. Treasury, fees paid by the FRBNY, and interest received on investments.  In addition, the table presents the book value of the outstanding principal of the loan extended by the FRBNY, the book value of the accrued interest payable to the FRBNY, and the book value of the funding provided by the U.S. Treasury to TALF LLC, which includes the accrued interest payable to the U.S. Treasury.</description><dc:date>2009-11-19T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>TALF LLC</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2009-11-19T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H41</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#200"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#200</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue an annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization on in late March 2010.</description><dc:date>2009-10-16T09:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2009-10-16T09:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#196"><title>Z1: Correction to tables R.100, R.102, and R.103</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#196</link><description>The Z.1 Flow of Funds statistical release was re-posted on September 18, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. to correct errors affecting tables R.100, R.102, and R.103.

Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to decrease 0.3 percent this year after having expanded 1.5 percent in 2008. Manufacturing capacity is estimated to decline 0.6 percent in 2009 after having risen 1.7 percent last year. In 2009, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.8 percent, about the same as in 2008, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.7 percent, which is 0.5 percentage point slower than it had last year. With the publication on March 27, 2009, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Plant Capacity for the fourth quarter of 2008, which covers manufacturing.</description><dc:date>2009-02-18T09:15:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2009-04-01T00:00:00-04:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle> Preliminary Estimates of Industrial Capacity for 2009</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2009-02-18T09:15:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#106"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#106</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue an annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization on March 27, 2009.</description><dc:date>2009-01-16T09:15:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2009-04-01T00:00:00-04:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2009-01-16T09:15:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#105"><title>H15: No Update on January 19 and January 20</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#105</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board will be closed on Monday, January 19, and Tuesday, January 20.

By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to the sum of credit extended through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs and credit extended through certain Federal Reserve liquidity facilities.  Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve are presented in table 1a of the release.  Over much of 2008, in order to maintain a level of total reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's objective for the federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves were offset through a nearly commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which was accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities and other assets.  The negative level of nonborrowed reserves was an arithmetic result of the fact that borrowings from the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities were larger than total reserves.
More recently, nonborrowed reserves have again turned positive.  This development is purely an arithmetic result, in this case of the fact that a large volume of reserves has recently been provided through channels that, for purposes of the Federal Reserve's statistical releases, are not considered borrowings.  These channels include foreign currency swap arrangements with foreign central banks and certain special purpose vehicles.  Credit extended to these special purpose vehicles are not shown on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  Rather, as noted on the H.4.1 statistical release, the assets of these vehicles are consolidated onto the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and consequently credit extended to these special purpose entities is not treated as a borrowing for purposes of the H.3 statistical release.</description><dc:date>2008-12-29T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Note on Nonborrowed Reserves</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-12-29T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H3</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#101"><title>H15: No Update on December 26</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#101</link><description>The Federal Reserve Board will be closed on Friday, December 26.

Thus the rates published after September 19, 2008, likely reflect the direct or indirect effects of the new temporary programs and, accordingly, likely are not comparable for some purposes to rates published prior to that period.Through November 4, the documentation on the "About" page of this release indicated that paper issued under "credit-enhanced programs" was excluded from the samples of issues used to calculate reported rates.  This wording was intended to convey that asset-backed commercial paper was excluded from the calculation of financial rates.  Indeed, consistent with that intent, the Federal Reserve has, since 2006, published a separate rate series for asset-backed commercial paper.  To avoid confusion, the reference to "credit-enhanced programs" will be dropped.</description><dc:date>2008-11-05T09:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Clarification of Criteria Considered for Commercial Paper Rates</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-11-05T09:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>CP</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#93"><title>Z1: Next Z.1 Release Date</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#93</link><description>The next Z.1 Release date is Thursday December 11, 2008; at 12:00 noon.</description><dc:date>2008-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Next Z.1 Release Date</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>Z1</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#90"><title>G17: Capacity Utilization Rates for October 2007 - February 2008 Updated</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#90</link><description>Capacity utilization rates for October 2007 through February 2008 have been updated with the G.17 Statistical Release published on September 15, 2008.

The balance sheet items on the seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted pages are now identical.





For large domestically chartered banks, former item 4d, "Other securities, Investment account, Other," has been disaggregated into items 4b2 and 4b3, "Mortgage-backed" and "Other." Historical data beginning October 2, 1996, are available on the Federal Reserves web site.





For foreign-related institutions, former item 7, "Real estate loans," has been renumbered as item 10 and renamed "Commercial real estate," which reflects the loan category more accurately.




For small domestically chartered banks, former item 9, "Real estate loans, other,"  has been disaggregated into items 9 and 10, "Other residential" and "Commercial."  Historical data beginning June 2, 2004, are available on the web site.





For seasonally adjusted assets of large and small domestically chartered banks, former item 10, "Consumer loans," has been renumbered as item 11 and disaggregated into items 12 and 13, "Credit cards and other revolving plans" and "Other." Historical data beginning June 28, 2000, are available on the web site.




For domestically chartered commercial banks and foreign-related institutions, former item 11, "Security loans," has been renumbered as item 14 and disaggregated into items 15 and 16, "Fed funds and RPs with brokers" and "Other." Historical data beginning January 3, 1973, are available on the web site.




For foreign-related institutions, former item 12, "Other loans and leases," has been renumbered as item 17 and disaggregated into items 17a and 17b, "Fed funds and RPs with others" and "Other." Historical data beginning January 3, 1973, are available on the web site.





For small domestically chartered banks and foreign-related institutions, former item 13, "Interbank loans," has been renumbered as item 18 and disaggregated into items 19 and 20, "Fed funds and RPs with banks" and "Other." Historical data are available on the web site beginning January 6, 1988, for small domestically chartered banks and January 3, 1973, for foreign-related institutions.  




For foreign-related institutions, former item 19, "Nontransaction deposits," has been renumbered as item 26 and a component, "Large time" has been added (item 27). Historical data beginning January 3, 1973, are available on the web site.




For large domestically chartered banks and foreign-related institutions, former memo items 29 and 30, "Reval. gains (losses) on off-bal. sheet items," have been renamed as "Derivatives with a positive (negative) fair value" and moved onto the balance sheet as items 4a1 and 33a. The remaining memo items have been moved to the end of the balance sheet pages. Historical data beginning October 2, 1996, are available on the web site.

Manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase 2.1 percent in 2008, the same amount as in 2007. In 2008, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.7 percent, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.9 percent; both rates of increase would be slightly faster than for last year. With the publication on March 28, 2008, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the 2006 Survey of Plant Capacity, physical capacity data from government and trade sources, and the revised production indexes.</description><dc:date>2008-02-15T09:15:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2009-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Preliminary estimates of industrial capacity for 2008</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-02-15T09:15:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#75"><title>G17: G.17 Annual Revision</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#75</link><description>February 15, 2008: The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue an annual revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization on March 28, 2008.</description><dc:date>2008-02-15T09:15:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2009-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>G.17 Annual Revision</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-02-15T09:15:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#73"><title>H3: Recent Declines in Nonborrowed Reserves</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#73</link><description>
The H.3 statistical release indicates that nonborrowed reserves of
depository institutions have declined substantially since mid-December
to a level that is now negative. This development reflects the
provision of a large volume of reserves through the Term Auction
Facility (TAF) and has no adverse implications for the availability of
reserves to the banking system.

By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves
minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to credit extended
through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs as well
as credit extended through the TAF. To maintain a level of total
reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's target
federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves must generally be
met by a commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which is
accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of
securities and other assets. The negative level of nonborrowed reserves
is an arithmetic result of the fact that TAF borrowings are larger than
total reserves.</description><dc:date>2008-02-07T19:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Recent Declines in Nonborrowed Reserves</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2008-02-07T19:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H3</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#72"><title>G19: Correction to Consumer Credit interest rate observation</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#72</link><description>The interest rate on 48-month car loans for November was incorrectly reported as 8.41% in the release and data published on January 8.

The seasonally adjusted data released on July 13, 2007--both the H.8
statistical release and the associated historical data--were based
inadvertently on a set of newly estimated seasonal factors. These
seasonal factors did not represent our final estimates and should not
have been published. 
In today's H.8 statistical release and in the associated historical
data, we have restored the previous set of seasonal factors. In
addition, we have corrected the H.8 statistical release of July 13,
2007, by restoring the previous set of seasonal factors to those data.
We will publish newly estimated seasonal factors when they have been
finalized.</description><dc:date>2007-07-20T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for July 11, 2007</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2007-07-20T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#145"><title>H8: Changes to Items Reported on the Release for July 4, 2007</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#145</link><description>Effective with this release of data for July 4, 2007, several changes have been made to the balance sheet items reported for large and small domestically chartered commercial banks:


For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of large domestically chartered banks (pages 5 and 7), former item 12a, "State and local government" loans, and former item 12b, "Agricultural" loans, have been discontinued and the remaining three items under item 12 have been renumbered as 12a through 12c.  Data for the two discontinued items have been aggregated into renumbered item 12b, "All other loans."  
  

For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of small domestically chartered banks (pages 9 and 10), former item 11, "Security" loans, has been discontinued and data for this item have been aggregated into existing item 12, "Other loans and leases."



For memo items of large domestically chartered banks (page 13), former item 34, "Securitized business loans," has been discontinued.  On the same page, new item 34, "Securitized real estate loans," has been added to the memo items for both large and small domestically chartered banks.

The "Notes on the Data" section on page 14 of the H.8 Statistical Release contains information on the affected balance sheet items.Under FVO, banks generally have an irrevocable option to elect a fair value measurement for most financial assets and liabilities at their inception.  In addition, at the time of FVO adoption, banks have a one-time option to convert a broad array of existing asset and liability items to a fair value measurement basis.

With the publication of the annual revision to the G.17 on November 7, 2005, the monthly indicators for the industrial production indexes for the twenty industries that previously relied on electric power use were changed to production-worker hours for the period 1997 to the present. Although the indexes of electric power use will no longer be updated, the historical indexes will remain available from the historical data page for the G.17. A notice seeking comments on this action was originally published in the Federal Register on September 29, 2005; no comments were received during the public comment period, which ended on November 28, 2005.</description><dc:date>2005-12-06T16:30:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=2009-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Final survey of industrial electric power use</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2005-12-06T16:30:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>G17</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#15"><title>G17: Seasonal factors for auto and truck production</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#15</link><description>November 17, 2005: Seasonal factors for auto and truck production were modified to correct an error in the factors for January 2006.

June 1, 2004. The Treasury commenced publishing this rate on February
19, 2002, coinciding with the discontinuance of its 30-year constant
maturity rate. At that time, the Treasury began to publish an
"extrapolation factor," to allow users to calculate a proxy for the
30-year constant maturity rate. An extrapolation factor will continue
to be published, but, as of June 1, it will be based on an
extrapolation from the 20-year yield curve point. The extrapolation
factor is available at the Treasury website, www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/index.html, as reported in footnote 11 of the release.</description><dc:date>2004-06-02T10:53:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Discontinuance of Treasury Long-Term Average Nominal Rate</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2004-06-02T10:53:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#142"><title>H8: Revised Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for December 17, 2003</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#142</link><description>Commercial bank balance sheet data back to December 17, 2003, have been revised to reflect further information on consolidations of the assets and liabilities of variable interest entities onto the balance sheets of the banks that sponsor them.

Most of these declines reflect some banks' decisions to stop consolidating their VIEs in response to the announcement by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on October 9 that it had decided to defer the implementation of its Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities from the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. For further information, please see the FASB website, www.fasb.org. In addition, a small part of the decline reflects a restructuring of some VIEs so that they no longer need to be consolidated on bank balance sheets. The balance sheet items affected are other securities, item 4, other loans and leases, item 12, and borrowings from others, item 24. Some of these changes extend back to July 2. Revised data for the H.8 statistical release are available on the Board's website, www.federalreserve.gov/releases.</description><dc:date>2003-10-17T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for October 8, 2003</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2003-10-17T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#139"><title>H8: Supplementary Information Regarding Balance Sheet Data for October 1, 2003</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#139</link><description>Commercial bank balance sheet data for October 1, 2003, have been affected by consolidations of the assets and liabilities of several variable interest entities onto the balance sheets of the banks that sponsor them.

Monthly estimates of total bank credit and its major components,
seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, have been extended
back from January 1973, the former start date for all the bank credit
series, to January 1947. The components that have been extended are
holdings of U.S. government securities, holdings of other securities,
and the following loan categories: commercial and industrial, real
estate, consumer, security, and "all other."

Data in the H.8 are for all commercial banks in the United States,
which consist of domestically chartered banks and foreign-related
institutions (mainly U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks). The
data for 1973 through 1987 report totals for all institutions as well
as subtotals for domestically chartered banks and for foreign-related
institutions; beginning in 1988, the data are further disaggregated
between large and small domestically chartered banks. The extended data
(1947-72) show only all-institution totals.

As with the current data, the extended monthly data are prorated
averages of Wednesday values. The weekly Wednesday data underlying the
monthly averages mix actual historical observations with estimates that
are based on linear interpolations of semimonthly, monthly, and, in a
few cases, lower-frequency observations.  

Several bank credit series received generally minor revisions for
the 1973-87 period when the longer time series were introduced.</description><dc:date>2002-07-29T16:16:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Extension of Major Bank Credit Series to 1947</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2002-07-29T16:16:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#136"><title>H8: Discontinuation of District-specific balance sheet data</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#136</link><description>Effective with this edition of the H.8 statistical release, the Federal Reserve is discontinuing the publication of the District-specific balance sheet data of large, domestically chartered banks that appeared on pages 11 through 14 of the release. 
The reason for the change is that, with the ability of banks to establish branches virtually nationwide as of June 1, 1997, a number of large bank holding companies have converted banks located across several Federal Reserve Districts into branches of a single bank. These consolidations have significantly shifted bank balance sheet items among Federal Reserve Districts, further weakening the connection between banking data reported separately by Federal Reserve District and actual banking activities in each District. 
However, the item coverage of the aggregate balance sheets of large banks in the H.8 has been expanded to retain the national totals of some of the items in the District tables that had not appeared in the national tables. As a result, the H.8 now reports the large bank data on four pages rather than two. </description><dc:date>2002-07-29T16:15:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Discontinuation of District-specific balance sheet data</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2002-07-29T16:15:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H8</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#4"><title>H15: Changes to Treasury Long-Term Rate Series</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#4</link><description>As of the release dated February 25, 2002, the H.15 no longer
reports a 30-year constant maturity yield for Treasury securities and
begins reporting a yield for Treasury securities with 25 years or more
remaining to maturity.

The changes reflect the Treasury's announcement on January 30, 2002,
that, effective February 18, it would cease supplying an estimate of
the 30-year constant maturity yield and that it would commence
supplying a long-term yield based on a basket of long-dated securities.


As indicated in footnote 12 of the release, the new long-term rate
is based on an unweighted average of the bid yields for all Treasury
fixed-coupon securities with remaining terms to maturity of at least 25
years. A factor to adjust the daily long-term average to estimate a
30-year rate is available at the Treasury web site reported in footnote
13 of the release.</description><dc:date>2002-02-25T10:55:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Changes to Treasury Long-Term Rate Series</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2002-02-25T10:55:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#5"><title>H15: Original and Revised Treasury Rates for the Week Ending September 14, 2001</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#5</link><description>The H.15 site has links to the original September 17, 2001, release as well as
to the revised releases for that date and for September 24.

Data for most of the interest rates reported in the H.15 release of
September 17, 2001, were missing for September 11-13 because of
inactive markets or delays in data processing arising from the
disasters of September 11.

On September 25 the Treasury released the data that had been
missing for September 13 regarding the constant maturity interest
rates on Treasury securities and the secondary rates on bills.  On
October 1, 2001, the Federal Reserve issued a revised version of the
H.15 release of September 17 to show the September 13 values of those
series and the correspondingly updated values of the averages for the
week ending September 14; also on October 1, 2001, the Federal Reserve
issued a revised version of the September 24 release to show the new
values of the averages for the week ending September 14.</description><dc:date>2001-10-26T10:45:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Original and Revised Treasury Rates for the Week Ending September 14, 2001</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2001-10-26T10:45:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#6"><title>H15: Changes in the reporting of Treasury securities</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#6</link><description>On July 31, 2001, the Department of the Treasury began the weekly
issuance of 4-week bills. On August 27, 2001, the Treasury stopped
reporting secondary market yields for 1-year Treasury bills, the final
issuance of which was on February 27, 2001.  

Effective with the issue of September 4, 2001, the H.15 statistical
release reflects these changes by reporting the secondary market rate
for 4-week bills and by no longer reporting the secondary market rate
for 1-year bills. 

In addition, the H.15 now reports a 1-month constant maturity rate,
which the Treasury began calculating when it introduced the 4-week bill.</description><dc:date>2001-09-04T10:59:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Changes in the reporting of Treasury securities</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2001-09-04T10:59:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#83"><title>CHGDEL: Correction to delinquency rates at "other" banks</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#83</link><description>Delinquency rates at "other" banks were revised to correct a computational error.

Rates for fixed-rate payers in interest rate swaps, as collected under
the auspices of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
Inc., are being added.  These swap rates are for maturities of 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 7, 10, and 30 years.

No longer appearing on the release are auction highs for 3-month,
6-month, and 1-year Treasury bills.  These figures continue to be
available from the Treasury's website:

http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofrespr.htm.  Also
being dropped is the Treasury composite (an unweighted average of yields
on all outstanding bonds neither due nor callable in less than 10
years).

Finally, the H.15 no longer contains rates for 3-month and 6-month
bankers acceptances.  The quotes continue to be available on Telerate,
which was the source for these rates as reported on the H.15.</description><dc:date>2000-07-10T10:59:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Note to Users of the H.15 Statistical Release; The addition of swap rates.</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>2000-07-10T10:59:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#85"><title>CHGDEL: Partial estimation of delinquency rates in 1999:3</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#85</link><description>Owing to a reporting problem, delinquency rates for residential and commercial mortgage loans are partially estimated for the 100 largest banks for the third quarter of 1999.</description><dc:date>1999-11-17T12:00:00-05:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Partial estimation of delinquency rates in 1999:3</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>1999-11-17T12:00:00-05:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>CHGDEL</cb:keyword></cb:news></item><item rdf:about="http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#8"><title>H15: Change in the source of data for commercial paper</title><link>http://www.federalreserve.gov/feeds/DataDownload.html#8</link><description>AnnouncementAlso available in PDF format (PDF 22 KB)</description><dc:date>1997-05-12T11:01:00-04:00</dc:date><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>FRB</dc:publisher><dcterms:valid>end=9999-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</dcterms:valid><cb:news><cb:simpleTitle>Change in the source of data for commercial paper</cb:simpleTitle><cb:occurrenceDate>1997-05-12T11:01:00-04:00</cb:occurrenceDate><cb:keyword>H15</cb:keyword></cb:news></item></rdf:RDF>
