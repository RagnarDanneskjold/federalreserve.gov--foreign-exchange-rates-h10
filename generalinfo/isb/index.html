<br>
The passage of the Riegle&#0150;Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 will usher

in an era of widespread branch banking, changing the landscape

and structure of the banking industry throughout the United States.

Banks already are beginning to restructure to take advantage of the

efficiencies of the act. Widespread

branching networks, as well as regional networks

supported by affiliated bank relationships, can be expected.



<P>

Anticipating these changes, the Federal Reserve has

designed a new approach to providing accounting services and a new reserve account

structure.  To meet the needs of depository institutions for the convenience of

consolidated account management as well as the flexibility of multiple accounts, the Federal

Reserve has proposed that each depository institution hold a single

master account, which would be the view of

the institution's actual credit and debit position vis-&#0224;-vis the

Fed, with optional informational subaccounts.





<P>

The new account structure was developed in response to input from depository

institutions about their needs and after assessment of the Federal Reserve's current

account structure. The new account structure, with new accounting information services,

will be implemented on January 1, 1998.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will support

special transitional arrangements as institutions undergo organizational changes.<BR>



<P>

The following documents provide more information on the new account structure. As more

information becomes available, these documents will be updated and supplemented.<BR>
