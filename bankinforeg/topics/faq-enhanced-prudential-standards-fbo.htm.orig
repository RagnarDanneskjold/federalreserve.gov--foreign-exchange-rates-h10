       <em>Updated: June 26, 2014</em>
    
    <p>
       The frequently asked questions (FAQs) below are based on questions received by Board staff during an industry outreach call and other questions the Federal Reserve has received from foreign banking organizations (FBOs). For ease of reference, the questions have been grouped into categories: <a href="#imp-plan">implementation plan</a>, <a href="#us-struct">U.S. structure</a>, <a href="#reg-reporting">regulatory reporting</a>, <a href="#cap-adequacy">capital adequacy</a>, <a href="#stress-testing">capital stress testing</a>, <a href="#risk-mgmt">risk management</a>, <a href="#liquidity">liquidity</a>, and <a href="#other">other</a>. Additional categories may be added as these FAQs are updated.
    </p>
    <p>
       These FAQs are not official interpretations of the Board of Governors. These FAQs illustrate how select provisions of the regulation apply to specific situations. However, they do not necessarily address all provisions that may apply to any given situation. Board staff may supplement or revise these FAQs as necessary or appropriate in light of further questions and experience. These FAQs do not address the applicability of any other Federal or state laws.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>How should FBOs direct questions on the enhanced prudential standards to the Federal Reserve?<br />
         </strong>FBOs should submit questions on the enhanced prudential standards to the <a href="mailto:FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov">FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov</a> mailbox (the "mailbox") for a response. Questions and other materials submitted through the mailbox will be disseminated to the appropriate reviewers within the Federal Reserve System, including the relevant supervisory staff. If needed, meetings may be scheduled to discuss submitted questions and materials in more detail. Staff will respond in writing to the particular institution through the mailbox and may publish questions and responses of a general nature in future FAQ documents.<br />
        <br />
         The mailbox is only for use by supervised financial institutions. It is not for use by external consultants and counsel.

       Implementation Plan
    </h2>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>
        <strong>Does the Federal Reserve intend to issue further guidance on the implementation plan beyond the specifications in the final rule?<br />
         </strong>Board staff will respond to specific questions submitted by firms and may issue future FAQs. However, Board staff does not anticipate issuing further instructions regarding the content of the plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>
        <strong>What is the recommended scope and level of detail of the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>In its implementation plan, an FBO should assess the extent to which it is currently in compliance with the structural, capital, risk management, and liquidity requirements that come into effect on July 1, 2016; describe the actions that the FBO must take to come into compliance and provide a timeline for such actions; identify any obstacles or impediments that may affect the FBO's ability to come into compliance, and discuss how the FBO plans to address those obstacles/impediments. For example, an FBO should: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            discuss plans for the accretion, transfer, or raising of capital, if necessary to come into compliance with the final rule's requirements;
          </li>
          <li>
            discuss plans to address any liquidity shortfalls, which may include actions to lengthen the term of third-party funding or of intra-company loans or plans for the FBO to contribute highly liquid assets to its U.S. operations;
          </li>
          <li>
            discuss plans for development of management information systems (MIS) that can aggregate risk metrics across the combined U.S. operations, such as liquidity data; and
          </li>
          <li>
            describe the projected structure, roles, and responsibilities of the U.S. risk committee, including how that risk committee will interact with the larger global operations and how the firm will avoid potential conflicts of interest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="4">
      <li>
        <strong>What format should FBOs use to provide pro-forma quarterly financial statements?<br />
         </strong>The Federal Reserve has not required a specific format for submitting pro-forma financial statements. Board staff would encourage FBOs to use the Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (<a target="_self" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx">FR Y-9C</a>) regulatory report format and instructions as a guide for preparing the pro-forma financial statements. However, firms may use their own format to submit pro-forma financial statements.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="5">
      <li>
        <strong>For the implementation plan, what length is considered appropriate?<br />
         </strong>Board staff does not have a view on the appropriate length of a plan other than that the plan should include detail that is sufficient to allow Board staff to assess whether it is reasonable and achievable. The length of the plan will vary among firms, depending on several factors. Those factors include the structural and legal complexity of the FBO's combined U.S. operations, the number of exemption requests, the extent to which the FBO must take actions to come into compliance with the final rule, and the number of obstacles that the FBO faces related to compliance with the final rule.<br />
        <br />
         FBOs should consider providing an executive summary for those areas of the plan that require a lengthy discussion and providing supporting documents and exhibits in order to facilitate review of the plan. Following an FBO's submission of the implementation plan, Board staff will review the FBO's implementation project plans through the normal supervisory process to ensure that FBOs are progressing toward full compliance.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>
        <strong>What time period should the quarterly pro-forma financial statements cover?<br />
         </strong>Board staff would prefer for financial data to begin December 31, 2014 and end December 31, 2017.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="7">
      <li>
        <strong>What forecasting scenarios should FBOs use to prepare the pro-forma financial statements?<br />
         </strong>The forecast should be a realistic forecast of the balance sheet and income statements under expected conditions, using conservative assumptions. The forecast should not be a post-stress analysis.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="8">
      <li>
        <strong>Do high quality liquid assets under the Board's proposed liquidity coverage ratio (proposed U.S. LCR as will it be finalized) qualify as highly liquid assets for purposes of the liquidity buffer? Will it be sufficient for an FBO to describe the assets it intends to hold in its buffer in the implementation plan (with any relevant haircuts) or is there another process for demonstrating the appropriateness of additional highly liquid assets?<br />
         </strong>As noted in the preamble, the Board anticipates that high-quality liquid assets under the proposed U.S. LCR would generally be liquid under most scenarios. However, firms are required by the final rule to demonstrate to the Board that inclusion of particular assets in the firm's buffer are: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            appropriate in light of the liquidity risk profile of the firm;
          </li>
          <li>
            meet the diversification requirement; and
          </li>
          <li>
            have appropriate haircuts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
         Assets that are not eligible for inclusion in the numerator of the LCR, but have low market or credit risk may be eligible for inclusion in the liquidity buffer required under Regulation YY. A summary of the firm's analysis of the assets included in its liquidity buffer should be included in the firm's implementation plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="9">
      <li>
        <strong>Can the Federal Reserve provide additional guidance on the level of description of risk-management practices that should be included in the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>The plan should include a description of the proposed structure of the risk committee for the FBO's combined U.S. operations and the intermediate holding company (IHC) risk committee, a description of the proposed placement and responsibilities of the U.S. chief risk officer (CRO), and a description of how the FBO will come into compliance with the risk management requirements in the final rule.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="10">
      <li>
        <strong>Does the Federal Reserve expect FBOs to discuss contemplated transfers of assets to branches or among subsidiaries in the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>Material asset transfers between a U.S. branch and subsidiaries should be included in the plan. All asset transfers would need to be in compliance with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation W.<br />
        <br />
         While the final rule does not prohibit asset transfers between U.S. subsidiaries and U.S. branches, in the open Board meeting, Board staff noted that the Federal Reserve would monitor material shifts of assets from subsidiaries to branches through the supervisory process and would take appropriate supervisory action to address safety and soundness concerns.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="11">
      <li>
        <strong>What level of detail regarding capital stress testing should be included in the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>The plan must address any need to develop the MIS, staff, and governance/oversight framework necessary to comply with the capital plan rule and the stress testing rule. Aspects to consider include the IHC's ability to: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            accurately complete the Capital Assessments and Stress Testing (<a target="_self" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx">FR Y-14A, Q, M</a>) regulatory reports;
          </li>
          <li>
            accurately calculate current consolidated capital positions; and
          </li>
          <li>
            forecast losses and revenues under baseline and stress scenarios to produce reliable estimates of future capital needs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="12">
      <li>
        <strong>Can requests for multiple U.S. IHCs or alternative organizational structures be included in the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>No. The implementation plan is not the appropriate vehicle for making formal requests for exemptions from the single IHC requirement. Those requests should be submitted separately to the <a href="mailto:FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov">mailbox</a>. However, the firm should note any exemption request in its implementation plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="13">
      <li>
        <strong>Can other requests for exemptions under the rule, such as a request to maintain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. IHC or to establish alternative U.S. CRO reporting lines, be included in the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>No, a firm requesting an exemption from the final rule should submit its request to the <a href="mailto:FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov">mailbox</a> separately from its implementation plan. However, the firm should note any exemption request in its implementation plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="14">
      <li>
        <strong>Should the FBO assume that exemptions requested in the implementation plan, such as requests to maintain individual subsidiaries outside of the IHC, are granted when presenting timelines, plans and pro-forma financial statements?<br />
         </strong>The plan should not assume that exemptions are granted.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="15">
      <li>
        <strong>Should the FBO assume that exemption requests for multiple U.S. IHCs or alternative organizational structures are granted when preparing the implementation plan?<br />
         </strong>Generally, Board staff expects that an FBO would submit an implementation plan that is consistent with the requirements of the final rule, including the requirement to form a single IHC, unless the FBO receives formal, written approval of an alternative structure from the Board. An FBO that plans to seek approval of an alternative organizational structure that would materially affect its implementation plan should seek guidance from Board staff as to whether the FBO should <strong><em>also</em></strong> reflect this alternative organizational structure in its implementation plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="16">
      <li>
        <strong>Does an FBO have to resubmit the implementation plan in the event of a material change?<br />
         </strong>The implementation plan is designed to permit the Federal Reserve to evaluate whether the FBO is on a path towards compliance with the final rule by July 1, 2016. If there is a material change that would affect the firm's ability to be in compliance by that date, an FBO is expected to revise its plan to reflect the material changes. A "material change" would be an event that would materially affect the path towards compliance, such as a sizeable merger or acquisition transaction, sale or wind-down of major business lines or assets, or a material restatement of financial reports. Changes made to the plan after the January 1, 2015 deadline should be submitted to the <a href="mailto:FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov">mailbox</a> with an explanatory note. Board staff will endeavor to incorporate changes in the analysis of the plan made after that date but cannot guarantee that revisions received after the submission deadline will be reflected in our initial feedback on the plans.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="17">
      <li>
        <strong>Under what circumstances would the Federal Reserve entertain requests for extensions of the deadline for filing implementation plans?<br />
         </strong>All firms are expected to meet the filing timelines set forth in Regulation YY. If a bank is unclear about the requirements for the implementation plan, it should seek clarification via the <a href="mailto:FBO-Enhanced-Prudential-Standards-Implementation@frb.gov">mailbox</a>.

Further, the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C) reporting form requires that the form be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles apply to both operational and non-operational U.S. companies.

         </strong>As described in the preamble to the final rule, the final rule requires an FBO to hold its ownership interest in ABCP conduits that are "U.S. subsidiaries" under its IHC. The ABCP conduit would be a U.S. subsidiary, regardless of whether it is owned or managed by a branch or a foreign affiliate, and enhanced prudential standards that apply to the FBO's U.S. subsidiaries would apply to such an ABCP conduit. Under Regulation YY, U.S. non-branch assets include the consolidated assets of each top-tier U.S. subsidiary of the foreign banking organization.

         </strong>If an FBO designates an existing BHC as its U.S. IHC, that U.S. IHC would continue to be subject to the leverage ratio, the capital plan rule, or the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) stress testing requirements, and would not be able to take advantage of any transition periods under Regulation YY. If and when an FBO moves a subsidiary into the existing BHC, the leverage ratio applied to that BHC would be calculated on the basis of the assets of the BHC, including the assets of the new subsidiary, and stress tests should account for the integration of the new subsidiary's assets into the BHC.

         </strong>An FBO that does not meet the asset threshold (as measured under the rule) for establishing a U.S. IHC but elects to form an "intermediate" holding company would not be subject to the regulatory requirements imposed on a "U.S. IHC" under Regulation YY.<br />

         </strong>The supplementary leverage ratio goes into effect on January 1, 2018. The capital plan rule requires a company to project its capital levels using the capital rules that would be in effect during each quarter of the planning horizon. Thus, where applicable, IHCs should expect that they will have to meet a 3 percent supplementary leverage ratio on a post-stress basis during the later quarters of the planning horizon covered by their first capital plan in 2017.

         </strong>Capital stress-testing requirements for the U.S. branch and agency network apply at the consolidated level. Under Regulation YY, by July 1, 2016, an FBO with a U.S. branch or agency with $10 billion or more in global consolidated assets must be subject to an annual consolidated capital stress testing regime administered by the FBO's home-country supervisor and meet the home-country supervisor's minimum standards. (12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.122; 252.146; 252.158) In addition, an FBO with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must report certain information to the Board regarding the results of that stress test. (12 C.F.R. &sect; 252.158)<br />
        <br />
         FBOs that do not meet these stress testing requirements are subject to an asset maintenance requirement and must conduct an annual stress test of any U.S. subsidiaries and report the results to the Board. (12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.122; 252.146; 252.158) Additionally, the Board may subject FBOs with $50 billion or more in combined U.S. assets that do not meet these stress requirements to intragroup funding restrictions and liquidity requirements.

        <strong>The rule states that, for calculation of the net external stressed cash-flow need, the FBO can calculate its stressed-cash flow based on the result of stress testing with an appropriate assumption of run-off and haircuts. What is the appropriate treatment of a U.S. branch that procures funds by repo transactions from external parties that mature within a 14 day period? May the branch assume the roll-over of repo transactions with stress assumptions (i.e. larger haircut, partial roll-over, etc.) or must the branch assume 100 percent outflow of cash (i.e. no roll-over), but count returned (i.e. released or unencumbered) collateral as liquid assets?<br />
         </strong>If firms are able to rehypothecate collateral they hold that has been pledged to them to secure a loan (but have not done so), and if the collateral meets the definition of a highly liquid asset, the collateral may qualify as a highly liquid asset with appropriate haircuts. Appropriate haircuts and calculations of inflows and outflows would depend on the specific terms of the reverse repo transaction. Inflows related to secured loans can be considered in the measurement of net cash need, but the firm should also consider the stress scenario and reputational factors to determine if it would continue to renew and make new loans.<br />
        <br />
         The rule does not specifically prescribe an outflow rate for secured transactions. It is acceptable for firms to assume differentiated outflows dependent on the underlying collateral supporting the secured borrow.

         </strong>Within the IHC structure, the liquidity buffer requirement is consolidated, so qualifying buffer assets at any entity within the IHC structure could count toward the consolidated requirement.<br />
        <br />
         A firm's comprehensive internal liquidity stress testing should take into account restrictions relating to the movement of liquidity across legal entities or jurisdictions that may occur within a stress scenario. In general, sound liquidity risk management relies on liquidity that is readily available to meet outflows in a time of stress. To the extent a firm intends to hold a material amount of buffer assets in a U.S. legal entity that creates impediments to covering expected outflows from other U.S. legal entities in a stress event, the firm should be able to articulate why such an arrangement is appropriate from a liquidity risk management standpoint, and should include a description of their reasoning in their implementation plan.

         </strong>Yes. As set forth in section 252.156(d) of Regulation YY, an FBO must produce comprehensive cash-flow projections for its combined U.S. operations.

        <strong>How would the liquidity stress testing and monitoring apply to Cayman branches?<br />
         </strong>The final rule's liquidity stress testing and monitoring apply only to the combined U.S. operations of an FBO.

         </strong>Yes, a U.S. branch may use foreign government debt held at a U.S. bank custody account at one of the custody bank's foreign branches in its liquidity buffer, assuming the bonds meet the highly liquid asset definition and the branch has the ability to liquidate that debt in a stress scenario. To the extent a firm intends to hold a material amount of buffer assets in an account subject to restrictions relating to the movement of liquidity across legal entities or jurisdictions, the firm should discuss in its implementation plan its ability to monetize the assets during a stress scenario. The preamble also notes that currency risk is one of the factors that should be considered when assessing haircuts associated with foreign bonds.

         The report of pledged collateral positions should show the overall collateral position and provide management a good understanding of the position.

The FBO should have three distinct stress tests: a scenario reflecting adverse market conditions, a scenario reflecting an idiosyncratic stress event for the bank, and combined scenario reflecting both an idiosyncratic market stress event. The stress needs to be sufficiently dynamic to incorporate changes in the covered company's on balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities, funding profile, portfolio composition, asset quality, operating environment, and business strategy. The stress tests should look beyond assumptions based only on historic data, and incorporate new events and potential stressed scenarios.

         The expectation is that firms will set liquidity risk limits that are consistent with the established liquidity risk tolerance for the combined U.S. operations and reflect the capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size of the combined U.S. operations. The risk management function is not required to set those limits; however, the risk management and the independent review function must, at a minimum, review and assess compliance with such limits.

Or is the requirement for stand-alone review by the CRO?</strong><br />
         The rule requires that assumptions be approved by the CRO, who may be a member of senior management. However, the assumptions must be approved by the CRO in his or her capacity as CRO and not in any other capacity. While the CRO can be part of the ALCO, the CRO must approve of the assumptions in the liquidity stress testing, with such approval documented. Membership on a group that approves the assumptions does not meet the requirement.

         Although the CRO may be part of the ALCO, the CRO's approval of the risk management policies required by Regulation YY must be documented. This obligation cannot be fulfilled by the approval of a senior management group that does not include a documented approval of the CRO.
