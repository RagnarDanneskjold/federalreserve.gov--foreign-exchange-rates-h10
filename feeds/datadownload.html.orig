<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in June after declining 0.3 percent in May. For the second quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, its third consecutive quarterly decline. Manufacturing output moved up 0.4 percent in June, a gain largely due to an increase in motor vehicle assemblies. The output of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. The index for utilities rose 2.4 percent as a result of warmer weather than is typical for June boosting demand for air conditioning. The output of mining moved up 0.2 percent for its second consecutive small monthly increase following eight straight months of decline. At 104.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in June was 0.7 percent lower than its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.5 percentage point in June to 75.4 percent, a rate that is 4.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2015 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/20160715/">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and private sources as well as updated estimates of capital spending by industry. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016, is now expected to increase 0.4 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point lower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is now expected to rise 0.7 percent, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than the previous estimate; a smaller increase in the capacity for manufacturing of selected high-technology goods accounts for the downward revision. The decrease in mining capacity for 2016 is unrevised at 3.4 percent, and the gain in capacity for utilities is also unrevised at 0.8 percent.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.4 percent in May after increasing 0.6 percent in April. Declines in the indexes for manufacturing and utilities in May were slightly offset by a small gain for mining. The output of manufacturing moved down 0.4 percent, led by a large step-down in the production of motor vehicles and parts; factory output aside from motor vehicles and parts edged down 0.1 percent. The index for utilities fell 1.0 percent, as a drop in the output of electric utilities was partly offset by a gain for natural gas utilities. After eight straight monthly declines, the production at mines moved up 0.2 percent. At 103.6 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in May was 1.4 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in May to 74.9 percent, a rate that is 5.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in April after decreasing in the previous two months. Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent after declining the same amount in March. The index for utilities jumped 5.8 percent in April, as the demand for electricity and natural gas returned to a more normal level after being suppressed by warmer-than-usual weather in March. Mining production fell 2.3 percent in April, and it has decreased more than 1 1/2 percent per month, on average, over the past eight months. At 104.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in April was 1.1 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.5 percentage point in April to 75.4 percent, a rate that is 4.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.6 percent in March for a second month in a row. For the first quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 2.2 percent. A substantial portion of the overall decrease in March resulted from declines in the indexes for mining and utilities, which fell 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively; in addition, manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent. The sizable decrease in mining production continued the industry's recent downward trajectory; the index has fallen in each of the past seven months, at an average pace of 1.6 percent per month. At 103.4 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.5 percentage point in March to 74.8 percent, a rate that is 5.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

The index provides an estimate of year-to-year price changes for computer storage equipment assuming that the quality of the device is unchanged. Data from IDC, a company specializing in information technology industries, were used to construct a matched-model quarterly price index, which was then converted to an annual index. This annual price index was incorporated into the industrial production indexes for computer storage equipment at the time of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization that was published on April 1, 2016.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve has <a href="/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">revised</a> its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Total IP is now reported to have increased about 2 1/2 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2014 before falling 1 1/2 percent in 2015. Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change are lower, especially for 2014 and 2015. Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its pre-recession peak in November 2014, six months later than previously estimated. Capacity for total industry is now reported to have increased about 2 percent in 2014 and 2015 after having increased only 1 percent in 2013. Compared with the previously reported estimates, the gain in 2015 is 1/2 percentage point higher, and the gain in 2013 is 1/2 percentage point lower. Industrial capacity is expected to increase 1/2 percent in 2016.</p>

The output of utilities dropped 4.0 percent, as unseasonably warm weather curbed the demand for heating. Mining production fell 1.4 percent and has decreased nearly 1.3 percent per month, on average, over the past six months. At 106.3 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in February was 1.0 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in February to 76.7 percent, a rate that is 3.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2015) average.</p>

                    <br />On January 6, 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced the implementation date for two changes to the calculation of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR). Effective March 1, the data source for the EFFR will move from aggregated data provided by federal funds brokers to transaction-level data reported by depository institutions.  In addition, the calculation method will change from a volume-weighted average to a volume-weighted median.<br />
                    <br />The H.15 will include the new EFFR rate on March 2, with data for March 1, 2016.  More information, including additional detail on the calculation methodology, will also be published March 2.<br />

                    <br />This release includes seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components produced with revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2015 and estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure.[1] While the updated seasonal factors resulted in revisions to the growth rates of seasonally adjusted M2 for individual months in 2015, the growth rates for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first and second half of 2015 were roughly unchanged.  <br />
                    <br />This release also includes a new quarterly benchmark, which incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters.[2]   These revisions to deposit data start in 2012.  In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2015.  Likewise, the benchmark incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 2015.  This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. <br />
                    <br />The effects of both the revisions to seasonal factors and the new quarterly benchmark on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. <br />
                    <br />Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/statisticsdata.htm.<br />

<p>Industrial production declined 0.4 percent in December, primarily as a result of cutbacks for utilities and mining. The decrease for total industrial production in November was larger than previously reported, but upward revisions to earlier months left the level of the index in November only slightly below its initial estimate. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent. Manufacturing output edged down in December. The index for utilities dropped 2.0 percent, as continued warmer-than-usual temperatures reduced demand for heating. Mining production decreased 0.8 percent in December for its fourth consecutive monthly decline. At 106.0 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in December was 1.8 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.4 percentage point in December to 76.5 percent, a rate that is 3.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST), which was enacted on December 4, 2015, requires that aggregate Federal Reserve Bank surplus not exceed $10 billion.  Therefore, any amount of aggregate Reserve Bank surplus that exceeds this limit will be remitted to the U.S. Treasury.  The line "Interest on Federal Reserve Notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 6 has been replaced with "Earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury" and footnotes to tables 1, 5, and 6 have been similarly modified.  <br />
                    <br />The amounts of the line items "Other liabilities and capital" on table 1, and "Surplus" on tables 5 and 6 reflect the payment of approximately $19.3 billion to Treasury on December 28, 2015, which was necessary to reduce aggregate Reserve Bank surplus to the $10 billion limitation in the FAST Act.</description>

<p>Industrial production declined 0.6 percent in November after decreasing 0.4 percent in October. In November, manufacturing production was unchanged from October. The index for utilities dropped 4.3 percent, as unusually warm weather held down the demand for heating. The index for mining fell 1.1 percent in November, with much of this decrease attributable to sizable declines for coal mining and for oil and gas well drilling and servicing. At 106.5 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in November was 1.2 percent below its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector declined 0.5 percentage point in November to 77.0 percent, a rate that is 3.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve released updated microprocessor price index with new data for 2012 and 2013. This price index was previously issued in 2013 with data for 2007 through 2011. The updated price index was incorporated into the industrial production index for semiconductors and related electronic components published on July 21, 2015, as a part of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization.<br />
                    </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve also issued an annual price index for computer storage equipment for the period 2002 through 2014. The index provides an estimate of year-to-year price changes for computer storage equipment assuming that the quality of the device is unchanged. Data from IDC, a company specializing in information technology industries, were used to construct a matched-model quarterly price index, which was then converted to an annual index. This annual price index was incorporated into the industrial production indexes for computer storage equipment at the time of the annual revision to the G.17 statistical release on industrial production and capacity utilization that was published on July 21, 2015.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.2 percent in September after edging down 0.1 percent in August. The decline in August is smaller than previously reported. In September, manufacturing output moved down 0.1 percent for a second consecutive monthly decrease; the index for mining fell 2.0 percent, while the index for utilities rose 1.3 percent. For the third quarter as a whole, total industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, and manufacturing output increased 2.5 percent. A strong gain for motor vehicles and parts contributed substantially to the quarterly increases. At 107.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in September was 0.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector fell 0.3 percentage point in September to 77.5 percent, a rate that is 2.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.4 percent in August after increasing 0.9 percent in July. The increase in July is now estimated to be greater than originally reported last month, largely as a result of upward revisions for mining and utilities. Manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent in August primarily because of a large drop in motor vehicles and parts that reversed a substantial portion of its jump in July; production elsewhere in manufacturing was unchanged. The index for mining fell 0.6 percent in August, while the index for utilities rose 0.6 percent. At 107.1 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in August was 0.9 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector fell 0.4 percentage point in August to 77.6 percent, a rate that is 2.5 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in July after moving up 0.1 percent in June. In July, manufacturing output advanced 0.8 percent primarily because of an increase in motor vehicle assemblies. The output of motor vehicles and parts jumped 10.6 percent, and production elsewhere in manufacturing edged up 0.1 percent. The index for mining rose 0.2 percent, while the index for utilities fell 1.0 percent. At 107.5 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production in July was 1.3 percent above its year-earlier level. (The comparison base year for industrial production was advanced to 2012 in the annual revision to the statistics published on July 21, 2015.) Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.3 percentage point in July to 78.0 percent, a rate that is 2.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

 percent per year, on average, from 2011 through 2013 before advancing about 4-1/2 percent in 2014 and
 falling back somewhat in the first half of 2015.2  Relative to earlier reports, the current rates of change
 are lower--especially for 2012 and 2013.  For the most recent recession, total IP still shows a
 peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent, and the dates for the peak and trough are unaltered.  However,
 the lower rates of change for recent years indicate that the recovery in the industrial sector since the
 trough has been slower than reported earlier.  Total IP is now estimated to have returned to its
 pre-recession peak in May 2014, seven months later than previously estimated

Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in June but fell at an annual rate of 1.4 percent for the second quarter of 2015. In June, manufacturing output was unchanged: The output of motor vehicles and parts fell 3.7 percent, but production elsewhere in manufacturing rose 0.3 percent. The indexes for mining and utilities advanced 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.2 percent in May after falling 0.5 percent in April. The decline in April was larger than previously reported, but the rates of change for previous months were generally revised higher, leaving the level of the index in April slightly above its initial estimate. Manufacturing output decreased 0.2 percent in May and was little changed, on net, from its level in January. In May, the index for mining moved down 0.3 percent after declining more than 1 percent per month, on average, in the previous four months. The slower rate of decrease for mining output last month was due in part to a reduced pace of decline in the index for oil and gas well drilling and servicing. The output of utilities increased 0.2 percent in May. At 105.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 1.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.2 percentage point in May to 78.1 percent, a rate that is 2.0 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

Manufacturing output was unchanged in April after recording an upwardly revised gain of 0.3 percent in March. In April, the index for mining moved down 0.8 percent, its fourth consecutive monthly decrease; a sharp fall in oil and gas well drilling has more than accounted for the overall decline in mining this year.

                    <p>Starting on May 7th, 2015, publication of finance company auto loan terms of credit series will resume using a new source. The new series will be produced on a quarterly basis and will extend back to 2008Q1. The replaced finance company terms of credit series shown on prior G.19 releases will continue to be made available in the G.19 Data Download. The release will also contain revisions extending back to January 2006 that are primarily caused by updated seasonal factors and the benchmarking of estimates to data released by the Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau.</p> </description>

                    <p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">March 2015</a> are now available.</p>
<p>Industrial production decreased 0.6 percent in March after increasing 0.1 percent in February. For the first quarter of 2015 as a whole, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. The decline last quarter resulted from a drop in oil and gas well drilling and servicing of more than 60 percent at an annual rate and from a decrease in manufacturing production of 1.2 percent. In March, manufacturing output moved up 0.1 percent for its first monthly gain since November; however, factory output in January is now estimated to have fallen 0.6 percent, about twice the size of the previously reported decline. The index for mining decreased 0.7 percent in March. The output of utilities fell 5.9 percent to largely reverse a similarly sized increase in February, which was related to unseasonably cold temperatures. At 105.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 2.0 percent above its level of a year earlier. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.6 percentage point in March to 78.4 percent, a rate that is 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.1 percent in February after decreasing 0.3 percent in January. In February, manufacturing output moved down 0.2 percent, its third consecutive monthly decline. The rates of change for the total index in January and for manufacturing in both December and January are lower than previously reported. The index for mining fell 2.5 percent in February; drops in the indexes for coal mining and for oil and gas well drilling and servicing primarily accounted for the decrease. The output of utilities jumped 7.3 percent, as especially cold temperatures drove up demand for heating. At 105.8 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in February was 3.5 percent above its level of a year earlier. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased to 78.9 percent in February, a rate that is 1.2 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

                    <p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">January 2015</a> are now available.</p>
<p>Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in January after decreasing 0.3 percent in December. The rates of change in output for September through December are all slightly lower than previously published; even so, production is estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, manufacturing output moved up 0.2 percent and was 5.6 percent above its year-earlier level. The index for mining decreased 1.0 percent, with the decline more than accounted for by a substantial drop in the index for oil and gas well drilling and related support activities. The output of utilities increased 2.3 percent. At 106.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 4.8 percent above its level of a year earlier. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector was unchanged in January at 79.4 percent, a rate that is 0.7 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2014) average.</p>

                    <br />This release includes seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components produced with revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2014 and estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure.[1]  The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2014 and a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half.<br />
                    <br />This release also includes a new quarterly benchmark, which incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters.[2]  These revisions to deposit data start in 2013.  In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2014.  Likewise, the benchmark incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 1996.  This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data.<br />
                    <br />The effects of both the revisions to seasonal factors and the new quarterly benchmark on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7.<br />
                    <br />Historical data, updated each week, are available with the H.6 statistical release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases.<br />---------<br />[1]  Information on the X-12-ARIMA procedure is available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a.<br /> <br />[2]  "Call Reports" refers to the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031 and 041; OMB No. 7100-0036) and the credit union Statement of Financial Condition (NCUA 5300/5300SF; OMB No. 3133-0004). <br />

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.1 percent in December after rising 1.3 percent in November. The decrease in December reflected a sharp drop in the output of utilities, as warmer-than-usual temperatures reduced demand for heating; excluding utilities, industrial production rose 0.7 percent. Manufacturing posted a gain of 0.3 percent for its fourth consecutive monthly increase. The index for mining increased 2.2 percent after falling in the previous two months. At 106.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 4.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. For the fourth quarter of 2014 as a whole, industrial production advanced at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, with widespread gains among the major market and industry groups. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector decreased 0.3 percentage point in December to 79.7 percent, a rate that is 0.4 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

                    <p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">November 2014</a> are now available.</p>
<p>Industrial production increased 1.3 percent in November after edging up in October; output is now reported to have risen at a faster pace over the period from June through October than previously published. In November, manufacturing output increased 1.1 percent, with widespread gains among industries. The rise in factory output was well above its average monthly pace of 0.3 percent over the previous five months and was its largest gain since February. In November, the output of utilities jumped 5.1 percent, as weather that was colder than usual for the month boosted demand for heating. The index for mining decreased 0.1 percent. At 106.7 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 5.2 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.8 percentage point in November to 80.1 percent, a rate equal to its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

                    <p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in July for its sixth consecutive monthly gain. Manufacturing output advanced 1.0 percent in July, its largest increase since February. The production of motor vehicles and parts jumped 10.1 percent, while output in the rest of the manufacturing sector rose 0.4 percent. The production at mines moved up 0.3 percent, its ninth consecutive monthly increase. The output of utilities dropped 3.4 percent, as weather that was milder than usual for July reduced demand for air conditioning. At 104.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in July was 5.0 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry edged up 0.1 percentage point to 79.2 percent in July, a rate 1.7 percentage points above its level of a year earlier and 0.9 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

                    <p>Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in June and advanced at an annual rate of 5.5 percent for the second quarter of 2014. In June, manufacturing output edged up 0.1 percent for its fifth consecutive monthly gain, while the production at mines moved up 0.8 percent and the output of utilities declined 0.3 percent. For the second quarter as a whole, manufacturing production rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, while mining output increased at an annual rate of 18.8 percent because of gains in the extraction of oil and gas; by contrast, the output of utilities fell at an annual rate of 21.4 percent following a weather-related increase of 15.6 percent in the first quarter. At 103.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in June was 4.3 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry was unchanged in June at 79.1 percent, a rate that is 1.0 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2013 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and trade sources as well as updated estimates of capital spending by industry. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014, is now expected to increase 3.1 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point faster than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 2.2 percent in 2014, a pace 0.4 percentage point less than in previous estimates; the downward revisions to capacity were widespread among manufacturing industries. The increase in mining capacity for 2014 has been revised up 3.4 percentage points to 9.2 percent, entirely as a result of an upward revision to the capacity for oil and gas extraction. The gain in capacity for utilities, at 1.0 percent, is unrevised.</p>

                      <br />Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in March after having advanced 1.2 percent in February. The rise in February was higher than previously reported primarily because of stronger gains for durable goods manufacturing and for mining. For the first quarter as a whole, industrial production moved up at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, just slightly slower than in the fourth quarter of 2013. In March, the output of manufacturing rose 0.5 percent, the output of utilities increased 1.0 percent, and the output of mines gained 1.5 percent. At 103.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 3.8 percent above its level of a year earlier. Capacity utilization for total industry increased in March to 79.2 percent, a rate that is 0.9 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2013) average but 1.2 percentage points higher than a year prior.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve Board issued its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">annual revision</a> to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. The annual revision for 2014 was more limited than in recent years because the source data required to extend the annual benchmark indexes of production into 2012 were mostly unavailable. Consequently, the IP indexes published with this revision are very little changed from previous estimates. Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have increased about 3 1/3 percent in each year from 2011 to 2013. Relative to the rates of change for total IP published earlier, the new rates are 1/2 percentage point higher in 2012 and little changed in any other year. Total IP still shows a peak-to-trough decline of about 17 percent for the most recent recession, and it still returned to its pre-recession peak in the fourth quarter of 2013.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in February after having declined 0.2 percent in January. In February, manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent and nearly reversed its decline of 0.9 percent in January, which resulted, in part, from extreme weather. The gain in factory production in February was the largest since last August. The output of utilities edged down 0.2 percent following a jump of 3.8 percent in January, and the production at mines moved up 0.3 percent. At 101.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in February was 2.8 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry increased in February to 78.8 percent, a rate that is 1.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.3 percent in January after having risen 0.3 percent in December. In January, manufacturing output fell 0.8 percent, partly because of the severe weather that curtailed production in some regions of the country. Additionally, manufacturing production is now reported to have been lower in the fourth quarter; the index is now estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter rather than 6.2 percent. The output of utilities rose 4.1 percent in January, as demand for heating was boosted by unseasonably cold temperatures. The production at mines declined 0.9 percent following a gain of 1.8 percent in December. At 101.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 2.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased in January to 78.5 percent, a rate that is 1.6 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2013) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in December, its fifth consecutive monthly increase. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production advanced at an annual rate of 6.8 percent, the largest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2010; gains were widespread across industries. Following increases of 0.6 percent in each of the previous two months, factory output rose 0.4 percent in December and was 2.6 percent above its year-earlier level. The production of mines moved up 0.8 percent; the index has advanced 6.6 percent over the past 12 months. The output of utilities fell 1.4 percent after three consecutive monthly gains. At 101.8 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 3.7 percent above its year-earlier level and 0.9 percent above its pre-recession peak in December 2007. Capacity utilization for total industry moved up 0.1 percentage point to 79.2 percent, a rate 1.0 percentage point below its long-run (1972-2012) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in November after having edged up 0.1 percent in October; output was previously reported to have declined 0.1 percent in October.

Production at mines advanced 1.7 percent to more than reverse a decline of 1.5 percent in October.

The first new statistic is the Mortgage DSR, defined as the total quarterly required mortgage payments divided by total quarterly disposable personal income. The second new statistic is the Consumer DSR, defined as the total quarterly required consumer debt payments divided by total quarterly disposable personal income. The DSR is the sum of the Mortgage DSR and the Consumer DSR. Most users should find the new DSR components more useful analytically than the former FOR components. The FOR components are being eliminated because of challenges inherent in measuring them accurately. Publication of the total FOR will continue.</description>

Following a decrease in July of 0.4 percent, which was steeper than previously reported, manufacturing production rose 0.7 percent in August. The output of mines moved up 0.3 percent, its fifth consecutive monthly increase, and the production of utilities fell 1.5 percent, its fifth consecutive monthly decrease. At 99.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in August was 2.7 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for the industrial sector increased 0.2 percentage point in August to 77.8 percent, a rate 0.6 percentage point above its level of a year earlier and 2.4 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2012) average.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board estimates seasonal factors for new light vehicle sales and provides these factors to The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for use in the National Income and Product Accounts. These factors are estimated once per year using X12-ARIMA and were last estimated in summer 2013, using vehicle sales data through April 2013. The seasonal factors for months that had not yet occurred were based on projections from the X12-ARIMA program. The factors will be revised again in summer 2014.</p>

                    <p>The estimates for industrial capacity in 2013 were revised for today's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">G.17 release</a>. The revisions reflect updated measures of physical capacity from various government and trade sources as well as updated estimates of industry capital spending. Capacity for the industrial sector, measured from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, is now expected to increase 1.8 percent, a rate that is 0.1 percentage point slower than previously estimated. Manufacturing capacity is expected to rise 1.6 percent in 2013, a pace 0.2 percentage point less than in previous estimates. Relative to the previous estimates, faster gains in the high-technology and motor vehicles industries have been more than offset by slower gains elsewhere in manufacturing. The increase in mining capacity for 2013 has been revised upward by 0.5 percentage point to 4.4 percent, while the change in capacity for utilities, at 0.9 percent, is 0.2 percentage point faster than previously estimated.</p>

<p>The amounts shown in table 1 of this release as "Unamortized premiums on securities held outright" and "Foreign currency denominated assets" were previously included as components of "Other Federal Reserve assets."  The footnote accompanying "Other Federal Reserve assets" in table 1 has been updated to identify the remaining major components, which include accrued interest, other accounts receivable, and bank premises.  The amount shown in table 1 of this release as "Unamortized discounts on securities held outright" was previously included as a component of "Other liabilities and capital." The release also reflects this additional detail on tables 8 and 9. </p>

Production at mines decreased 0.2 percent in March and edged down in the first quarter. In March, the output of utilities jumped 5.3 percent, as unusually cold weather drove up heating demand. At 99.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in March was 3.5 percent above its year-earlier level. The rate of capacity utilization for total industry moved up in March to 78.5 percent, a rate that is 1.2 percentage points above its level of a year earlier but 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2012) average.</p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve Board issued its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">annual revision</a> to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have increased 0.7 percentage point less in 2011 than was previously published. The revisions to IP for other years were smaller: Compared to the previous estimates, industrial production fell slightly less in 2008 and 2009 and increased slightly less in 2010 and 2012. At 97.7 percent of its 2007 average, the index in the fourth quarter of 2012 now stands 0.4 percent below its previous estimate. With these revisions, IP is still estimated to have advanced about 6 percent in 2010, the first full year following the trough in June 2009 of the most recent recession, but it is now estimated to have risen about 3 percent both in 2011 and in 2012. Since the trough of the recession, total IP has reversed about 90 percent of its peak-to-trough decline.</p>

<p>Industrial production edged down 0.1 percent in January after having risen 0.4 percent in December. In January, manufacturing output decreased 0.4 percent following upwardly revised gains of 1.1 percent in December and 1.7 percent in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole, manufacturing production is now estimated to have advanced 1.9 percent at an annual rate; previously, the increase was reported to have been 0.2 percent. In January, the output of utilities rose 3.5 percent, as demand for heating was boosted by temperatures that fell closer to their seasonal norms; the production at mines declined 1.0 percent. At 98.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 2.1 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased in January to 79.1 percent, a rate that is 1.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2012) average.</p>

This release includes revised monthly and weekly seasonal factors as well as comparisons of the revised monetary aggregates with previously published data. The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2012 and a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half.<br />
                    <br />The benchmark incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters. These revisions to deposit data start in 2011. In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2011. The benchmark also incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 2007. This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. <br />
                    <br />Seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components incorporate revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2012. Monthly seasonal factors were estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure. The effects of both the new benchmark and the revisions to seasonal factors on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. <br />

Manufacturing output advanced 0.8 percent in December following a gain of 1.3 percent in November; production edged up at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The output at mines rose 0.6 percent in December, and the output of utilities fell 4.8 percent as unseasonably warm weather held down the demand for heating. At 98.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 2.2 percent above its year-earlier level.

Effective with this release (for data collected for the week of November 5-12), the number of banks that is reporting the new items is sufficient to calculate meaningful summary statistics for those responses. Several changes, summarized below, have been made to the E.2 release. 
<ol>
<li>The minimum loan size reported on the survey is now $10,000, an increase from the previous minimum loan size of $7,500. This new minimum is reflected on all tables of the E.2 release.</li>
<li>Loans guaranteed, either in part or in whole, by the Small Business Association (SBA) are now identified. The percent of loans backed by the SBA are now shown on tables 1-6. A new table summarizing the terms of loans backed by the SBA has been added (table 7).</li>
<li>Loans made under syndication or participation are now identified. The percent of loans made under these arrangements are now shown on tables 1-6. A new table summarizing the terms of loans made under participation or syndication has been added (table 8). </li>
                    </ol>
<p>In addition to these changes, the time series from the aggregate data reported on the E.2 release will be available for customizable download through the Federal Reserve Board's Data Download Program (DDP) in late January. These data will be updated quarterly with the E.2 release. Finally, we will no longer provide a PDF of the E.2 release.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in November after having fallen 0.7 percent in October. The gain in November is estimated to have largely resulted from a recovery in production for industries that had been negatively affected by Hurricane Sandy, which hit the Northeast region in late October. In November, manufacturing output increased 1.1 percent after having decreased 1.0 percent in October; in addition to the storm-related rebound, a sizable rise in the production of motor vehicles and parts boosted factory output in November. The output of utilities advanced 1.0 percent, and production at mines rose 0.8 percent. At 97.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 2.5 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry increased 0.7 percentage point to 78.4 percent, a rate 1.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

                    <br />SPECIAL NOTICE<br />
                    <br />Data on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January 2011. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.[1] The maximum revision to total reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any maintenance period was $956 million; most revisions were less than $500 million. <br />
                    <br />A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and seasonal factors is available under <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/annualreview.htm">"Annual review of break and seasonal factors"</a> on the Federal Reserve's website. Historical data, updated each week, are available from the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/default.htm">Data Download Program</a> website.<br />
                    <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at each depository institution.  Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions.  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the low-reserve tranche is $71.0 million, rising to $79.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.  <br />Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from reserve requirements.  Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30).  For all reserve maintenance periods ending in 2012, the reserve requirement exemption is $11.5 million, rising to $12.4 million for maintenance periods ending in 2013.<br />

<p>Industrial production declined 0.4 percent in October after having increased 0.2 percent in September. Hurricane Sandy, which held down production in the Northeast region at the end of October, is estimated to have reduced the rate of change in total output by nearly 1 percentage point. The largest estimated storm-related effects included reductions in the output of utilities, of chemicals, of food, of transportation equipment, and of computers and electronic products. In October, the index for manufacturing decreased 0.9 percent; excluding storm-related effects, factory output was roughly unchanged from September. The output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent in October, and production at mines advanced 1.5 percent. At 96.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in October was 1.7 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.8 percent, a rate 2.5 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in September after having fallen 1.4 percent in August. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent in September but moved down at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the third quarter. Production at mines advanced 0.9 percent in September, and the output of utilities moved up 1.5 percent. Roughly 0.3 percentage point of the decline in overall industrial production in August reflected the effect of precautionary idling of production in late August along the Gulf of Mexico in anticipation of Hurricane Isaac, and part of the rise in September is a result of the subsequent resumption of activity at idled facilities. At 97.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in September was 2.8 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry moved up 0.3 percentage point to 78.3 percent, a rate 2.0 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production fell 1.2 percent in August after having risen 0.5 percent in July. Hurricane Isaac restrained output in the Gulf Coast region at the end of August, reducing the rate of change in total industrial production by an estimated 0.3 percentage point. Manufacturing output decreased 0.7 percent in August after having risen 0.4 percent in both June and July. Precautionary shutdowns of oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico in advance of the hurricane contributed to a drop of 1.8 percent in the output of mines for August. The output of utilities declined 3.6 percent. At 96.8 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in August was 2.8 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry moved down 1.0 percentage point to 78.2 percent, a rate 2.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board estimates seasonal factors for new light vehicle sales and provides these factors to The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) for use in the National Income and Product Accounts. These factors are estimated once per year using X12-ARIMA and were last estimated in summer 2012, using vehicle sales data through April 2012. The seasonal factors for months that had not yet occurred were based on projections from the X12-ARIMA program. The factors will be revised again in summer 2013.

Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines advanced 0.7 percent in June, while the output of utilities decreased 1.9 percent. For the quarter, however, the output of mines fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, while the output of utilities rose 14.9 percent.

At 97.3 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 4.7 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry declined 0.2 percentage point to 79.0 percent, a rate 1.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in April. Output is now reported to have fallen 0.6 percent in March and to have moved up 0.4 percent in February; previously, industrial production was estimated to have been unchanged in both months. Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in April after having decreased 0.5 percent in March. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, which increased nearly 4 percent, manufacturing output moved up 0.3 percent, and output for all but a few major industries increased. Production at mines rose 1.6 percent, and the output of utilities gained 4.5 percent after unseasonably warm weather in the first quarter held down demand for heating. At 97.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for April was 5.2 percent above its year-earlier level. The rate of capacity utilization for total industry moved up to 79.2 percent, a rate 3.1 percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 1.1 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.</p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in March for a second month but rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012. Manufacturing output declined 0.2 percent in March but jumped 10.4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. The gain in manufacturing output in the first quarter was broadly based: Even excluding motor vehicles and parts, which jumped at an annual rate of nearly 40 percent, manufacturing output moved up at an annual rate of 8.3 percent and output for all but a few major industries increased 5 percent or more. In March, production at mines rose 0.2 percent and the output of utilities gained 1.5 percent. For the quarter, however, the output of utilities dropped at an annual rate of 13.8 percent, largely as a result of unseasonably warm temperatures over the past several months, while the output of mining fell 5.4 percent. At 96.6 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for March was 3.8 percent above its year-earlier level. The rate of capacity utilization for total industry edged down to 78.6 percent, a rate 2.1 percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 1.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average. </p>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve Board issued its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm">annual revision</a> to the index of industrial production (IP) and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization. Data for the new series are available on the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/download.htm">Board's public website</a> and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=G17">Data Download Program</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Reserve has revised its index of industrial production (IP) 
and the related measures of capacity and capacity utilization.  Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total IP is now reported to have dropped 0.3 percentage point more in 2009; its gains in both 2010 and 2011 were essentially unchanged from what was previously 
reported.  With these minor revisions, the broad contour of total IP in recent years is similar to previous estimates.  Since the trough of the last recession in June 2009, total IP has reversed about three-fourths 
of its peak-to-trough decline.</p>
                    <p>Capacity utilization rates for recent years were revised down.  The 
revisions show that the rate of capacity utilization for total industry was 0.7 percentage point lower than previously estimated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 0.4 percentage point lower in 2011, primarily as a 
result of small upward revisions to estimates of industrial capacity. The capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was revised down 0.3 percentage point, and the rate in the final quarter of 2009 was revised down about 0.8 percentage point. </p>

                    <p>Industrial production and capacity utilization data for <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">January 2012</a> are now available.</p>
<p>Industrial production was unchanged in January, as a gain of 0.7 percent in manufacturing was offset by declines in mining and utilities. Within manufacturing, the index for motor vehicles and parts jumped 6.8 percent and the index for other manufacturing industries increased 0.3 percent. The output of utilities fell 2.5 percent, as demand for heating was held down by temperatures that moved further above seasonal norms; the output of mines declined 1.8 percent. Total industrial production is now reported to have advanced 1.0 percent in December; the initial estimate had been an increase of 0.4 percent. This large upward revision reflected higher output for many manufacturing and mining industries. At 95.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 3.4 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry decreased to 78.5 percent, a rate 1.8 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2011) average.</p>

This release includes revised monthly and weekly seasonal factors as well as comparisons of the revised monetary aggregates with previously published data. The revisions to the seasonal factors resulted in a higher growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the first half of 2011 and a lower growth rate for seasonally adjusted M2 in the second half. <br />
                    <br />The benchmark incorporates minor revisions to data reported in the weekly and quarterly deposit reports, and it takes account of deposit data from Call Reports for banks and thrift institutions that are not weekly or quarterly deposit reporters. These revisions to deposit data start in 2002. In addition, this release incorporates data from Call Reports on the amount of small-denomination time deposits held in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh accounts; related revisions to deposit data start in 2006. The benchmark also incorporates revisions to IRA and Keogh balances held at retail and institutional money market mutual funds; these revisions to data on money market mutual funds begin in 1996. This release also incorporates the receipt of historical information from other sources of data. <br />
                    <br />Seasonally adjusted measures of the monetary aggregates and components incorporate revised seasonal factors, which were derived from data through December 2011. Monthly seasonal factors were estimated using the X-12-ARIMA procedure. The effects of both the new benchmark and the revisions to seasonal factors on the growth rates of M1 and M2 are outlined in appendix tables 6 and 7. <br />

<p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in December after having fallen 0.3 percent in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent, its 10th consecutive quarterly gain. In the manufacturing sector, output advanced 0.9 percent in December with similarly sized gains for both durables and nondurables. The output of utilities fell 2.7 percent, as unseasonably warm weather reduced the demand for heating; the output of mines moved up 0.3 percent. At 95.3 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 2.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry rose to 78.1 percent, a rate 2.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2010) average.</p>

                  <description xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/" xmlns:cb="http://www.cbwiki.net/wiki/index.php/Specification_1.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">For release at <br />4:30 P.M. EDT <br />October 27, 2011 <br />
                    <br />SPECIAL NOTICE <br />
                    <br />Data on reserves and the monetary base have been revised to reflect the result <br />of annual reviews of seasonal factors and break factors. Revisions to seasonal <br />factors start in January 1999, while revisions to break factors begin in January <br />2010. Break factors remove discontinuities (or "breaks") associated with regulatory <br />changes in reserve requirements, such as the annual indexations of the low-reserve <br />tranche and the reserve requirement exemption.1 The maximum revision to total <br />reserves, nonborrowed reserves, required reserves, and the monetary base in any <br />maintenance period was $2.0 billion; most revisions were less than $700 million. <br />
                    <br />A more detailed description of the methods for constructing break factors and <br />seasonal factors is available under "Annual review of break and seasonal factors" <br />on the Federal Reserve's website (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/hist/">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/hist/</a>). <br />Historical data, updated each week, are available there as well. <br />
                    <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br />1. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 established a reserve ratio of 3 percent <br />against the first $25 million in net transaction deposits (low-reserve tranche) at <br />each depository institution. Since 1982, the low-reserve tranche has been indexed <br />each January by 80 percent of the previous year's (June 30 to June 30) growth rate <br />of net transaction deposits at all depository institutions. For all reserve <br />maintenance periods ending in 2011, the low-reserve tranche is $58.8 million, <br />rising to $71.0 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. <br />Under the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, the first $2 <br />million of reservable liabilities of each depository institution was exempted from <br />reserve requirements. Since 1983, this exemption amount has been indexed each year <br />by 80 percent of the rate of increase of the reservable liabilities at all <br />depository institutions over the preceding year (June 30 to June 30). For all <br />reserve maintenance periods ending in 2011, the reserve requirement exemption is <br />$10.7 million, rising to $11.5 million for maintenance periods ending in 2012. <br />

<p>Industrial production advanced 0.9 percent in July. Although the index was revised down in April, primarily as a result of a downward revision to the output of utilities, stronger manufacturing output led to upward revisions to production in both May and June. Manufacturing output rose 0.6 percent in July, as the index for motor vehicles and parts jumped 5.2 percent and production elsewhere moved up 0.3 percent. The output of mines advanced 1.1 percent, and the output of utilities increased 2.8 percent, as the extreme heat during the month boosted air conditioning usage. At 94.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production for July was 3.7 percentage points above its year-earlier level. The capacity utilization rate for total industry climbed to 77.5 percent, a rate 2.2 percentage points above the rate from a year earlier but 2.9 percentage points below its long-run (1972--2010) average. </p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in June after having edged down 0.1 percent in May. For the second quarter as a whole, total industrial production increased at an annual rate of 0.8 percent. Manufacturing output was unchanged in June.

<p>Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in May, the second consecutive month with little or no gain. Revisions to total industrial production in months before May were small. In May, manufacturing production rose 0.4 percent after having fallen 0.5 percent in April. The output of motor vehicles and parts has been held down in the past two months because of supply chain disruptions following the earthquake in Japan. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output advanced 0.6 percent in May and edged down 0.1 percent in April; the decrease in April in part reflected production lost because of tornadoes in the South at the end of the month. Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines increased 0.5 percent in May, while the output of utilities fell 2.8 percent. At 93.0 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in May was 3.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization for total industry was flat at 76.7 percent, a rate 3.7 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2010.</p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in April after having increased 0.7 percent in March. Output in February is now estimated to have declined 0.3 percent; previously it was reported to have edged up 0.1 percent. In April, manufacturing production fell 0.4 percent after rising for nine consecutive months. Total motor vehicle assemblies dropped from an annual rate of 9.0 million units in March to 7.9 million units in April, mainly because of parts shortages that resulted from the earthquake in Japan. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory production rose 0.2 percent in April. The output of mines advanced 0.8 percent, while the output of utilities increased 1.7 percent. At 93.1 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 5.0 percent above its year-earlier level.

<p>Industrial production declined 0.1 percent in February after having risen 0.3 percent in January; output in January was previously estimated to have edged down 0.1 percent. Manufacturing output increased 0.4 percent in February, and the gain in January was revised up to 0.9 percent. Outside of manufacturing, the output of mines rose 0.8 percent in February, which more than reversed its decline in January. However, the output of utilities fell 4.5 percent--the drop reflected unseasonably warm weather in February, which reduced the demand for heating after two months of unseasonably cold temperatures. At 95.5 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production was 5.6 percent above its year-earlier level. The capacity utilization rate for total industry edged down 0.1 percentage point to 76.3 percent, a rate 4.2 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2010.</p>

                    <br />The Board's H.3 statistical release, "Aggregate Reserves of Depository<br />Institutions and the Monetary Base," reflects the closing of the American<br />International Group, Inc. (AIG), recapitalization plan, which occurred on<br />January 14, 2011. The recapitalization plan was designed to restructure and<br />facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S.<br />Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Upon closing of the<br />recapitalization plan, the credit extended to AIG by the Federal Reserve Bank<br />of New York under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan), including accrued<br />interest and fees, was repaid in full. The AIG loan is reported in the "Credit<br />extended to American International Group, Inc., net" category of total and<br />other borrowings from the Federal Reserve, which is shown in table 1a of the<br />H.3 statistical release. <br />
                    <br />The average value of "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc.,<br />net" for the two-week period ending January 26, 2011, reflects the closing of<br />the AIG recapitalization plan. The average value for the two-week period<br />ending January 26, 2011, is greater than zero because the AIG loan was repaid<br />in full on January 14, the second day of this two-week period. Table 1a will<br />continue to show historical values for "Credit extended to American<br />International Group, Inc., net" to provide a complete disaggregation of total<br />and other borrowings from the Federal Reserve for past periods.<br />

The recapitalization plan was designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Federal Reserve.  Upon closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, specifically the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), were used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan), including accrued interest and fees, and then to redeem a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  The remaining FRBNY preferred interests in ALICO Holdings LLC and AIA Aurora LLC, valued at approximately $20 billion, were purchased by AIG through a draw on the Treasury's Series F preferred stock commitment and then transferred by AIG to the Treasury as consideration for the draw on the available Series F funds.<br />  <br />The weekly average values shown in table 1 reflect, as of January 14, 2011, the repayment by AIG of the "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net" and the "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and the distribution of the "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent."<br /> <br />The H.4.1 statistical release continues to show average amounts for "Credit extended to American International Group, Inc., net," "Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC," and "Funds from American International Group, Inc. asset dispositions, held as agent," even though all funding commitments to AIG have been terminated, to provide a complete disaggregation of changes in assets and liabilities from the corresponding week one year ago.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.8 percent in December after having risen 0.3 percent in November. The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in November but revised up in September and October; the net effect of the revisions from July to November left the level of industrial production in November slightly higher than was previously reported. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, a slower pace than in the earlier quarters of the year. In the manufacturing sector, output moved up 0.4 percent in December with gains in both durables and nondurables. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory output increased 0.5 percent. The output of mines advanced 0.4 percent; the output of utilities surged 4.3 percent, as unusually cold weather boosted the demand for heating. At 94.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 5.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry rose to 76.0 percent, a rate 4.6 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.</p>

                    <p>For release at<br />4:30 P.M. Eastern time<br />January 6, 2011</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to reflect an accounting policy change that will result in a more transparent presentation of each Federal Reserve Bank's capital accounts and distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Although the accounting policy change does not affect the amount of residual earnings that the Federal Reserve Banks distribute to the U.S. Treasury, it may affect the timing of the distributions.  Consistent with long-standing policy of the Board of Governors, the residual earnings of each Federal Reserve Bank, after providing for the costs of operations, payment of dividends, and the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in, are distributed weekly to the U.S. Treasury.  The distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is made in accordance with the Board of Governor's authority to levy an interest charge on the Federal Reserve Banks based on the amount of each Federal Reserve Bank's outstanding Federal Reserve notes.  </p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2011, as a result of the accounting policy change, on a daily basis each Federal Reserve Bank will adjust the balance in its surplus account to equate surplus with capital paid-in and, in addition, will adjust its liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  Previously these adjustments were made only at year-end.  Adjusting the surplus account balance and the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury is consistent with the existing requirement for daily accrual of many other items that appear in the Board's H.4.1 statistical release.  The liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury will be reported as "Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury" on table 10.  Previously, the amount necessary to equate surplus with capital paid-in and the amount of the liability for the distribution of residual earnings to the U.S. Treasury were included in "Other capital accounts" in table 9 and in "Other capital" in table 10.</p>

<p>Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in November after a decline of 0.2 percent in October. The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in October but up in September; the net effect of the revisions from June to October left the level of industrial production in October about the same as was previously reported. In the manufacturing sector, output advanced 0.3 percent in November with gains in both durables and nondurables. The gains among durable goods industries were particularly broad-based; only the production of motor vehicles and parts decreased substantially. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall factory output advanced 0.7 percent. The output of mines edged lower, but the output of utilities moved up 1.9 percent as the return of more seasonal temperatures boosted the demand for heating. At 93.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in November was 5.4 percent above its level a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry rose to 75.2 percent, a rate 5.4 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.</p>

<p>Industrial production was unchanged in October after having fallen 0.2 percent in September.  For the manufacturing sector, output gained 0.5 percent in October after having risen 0.1 percent in September.
 Factory production in September was initially reported to have decreased 0.2 percent, but incoming data on
 steel, fabricated metal products, machinery, and chemicals helped boost the index.  The output of utilities
 dropped 3.4 percent in October, as unseasonably warm temperatures reduced demand for heating.  Production at mines fell 0.1 percent.  At 93.4 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in October was 5.3 percent above its year-earlier level.  The capacity utilization rate for total industry was flat at 74.8 percent, a rate 6.6 percentage points above the low in June 2009 and 5.8 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.</p>

<p>
                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to report the funds held as agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) related to the recapitalization plan announced by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) on September 30, 2010.  The recapitalization plan, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2011, is designed to restructure and facilitate repayment of the financial support provided to AIG by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the FRBNY.  Pending the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain AIG asset dispositions will be held by the FRBNY as agent.  </p>
<p>At the closing of the recapitalization plan, the cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions, most notably the initial public offering of AIA Group Limited (AIA) and the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), will be used first to repay in full the credit extended to AIG by the FRBNY under the revolving credit facility (AIG loan) and then to retire a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC (preferred interests) taken earlier by the FRBNY in satisfaction of a portion of the AIG loan.  Alternatively, if the recapitalization plan is terminated under the terms of the plan, then the proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA and the sale of ALICO will be used to redeem the preferred interests in accordance with the AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC limited liability company agreements, and any excess proceeds from these transactions, as well as proceeds from the disposition of other assets, will be used to repay the AIG loan.  </p>
<p>The FRBNY began to hold as agent funds from the cash proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA on October 29, 2010, and from the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO on November 1, 2010.  </p>
<p>The funds held by the FRBNY as agent from the disposition of the AIG assets are reported in table 1 and are included in "Other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.</p>

(See <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/rrp_counterparties.html">http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/rrp_counterparties.html</a>). As a result of this expansion, the line "Dealers" under the heading "Reverse repurchase agreements" will be replaced with "Others" in table 1. Currently, the set of counterparties in the "Others" category is primary dealers and an eligible set of money market funds.</p>

<p>Industrial production decreased 0.2 percent in September after having increased 0.2 percent in August. The indexes both for manufacturing and for manufacturing excluding motor vehicles and parts also moved down 0.2 percent in September. Production at mines moved up 0.7 percent, while the output of utilities fell 1.9 percent. For the third quarter as a whole, total industrial production rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent after having advanced about 7 percent in both the first and second quarters of this year. The index for manufacturing decelerated sharply in the third quarter: After having jumped at an annual rate of 9.1 percent in the second quarter, factory output gained 3.6 percent in the third quarter. At 93.2 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in September was 5.4 percent above its year-earlier level. The capacity utilization rate for total industry edged down to 74.7 percent, a rate 4.2 percentage points above the rate from a year earlier but 5.9 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009. </p>

These distributions will also result in a corresponding reduction of the net portfolio holdings of the LLC.</p>

<p>
                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information on term deposits held by depository institutions.  Term deposits are a new tool that the Federal Reserve could use to manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions.  </p>
<p>On May 28, 2010, the Federal Reserve announced a schedule for three small-value auctions of term deposits to be offered through its Term Deposit Facility (TDF).  These auctions are intended to ensure the effective operation of the TDF and to help eligible institutions become familiar with the term deposit program.  The first auction was conducted on June 14, 2010, and settlement occurred on June 17, 2010.  The small-value TDF auctions are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy. </p>
<p>Information on the amount of term deposits outstanding is presented on table 1, table 10, and table 11.  The maturity distribution of term deposits is presented in table 2.</p>

                      <br />The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to report the maturity distribution of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities (central bank liquidity swaps).  These facilities were re-established in response to the re-emergence of strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets in Europe and are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers.</p>
<p>The maturity distribution of these swaps is reported again in table 2.  The release continues to show the outstanding dollar value of central bank liquidity swaps in tables 1, 10, and 11.  </p>

The percent changes will be updated weekly.  Data for a new month, quarter, or year will be published simultaneously with complete weekly data for the new month, quarter, or year.

                    <br />The percent changes have been adjusted to remove the effects of nonbank structure activity of $5 billion or more, as well as the estimated effects of the initial consolidation of certain variable interest entities (FIN 46) and off-balance-sheet vehicles (FAS 166/167).  The adjustments are generally made using the figures reported in the H.8 Notes on the Data.  A ratio procedure is used to adjust past levels to make them comparable with current levels.

                  <description xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/" xmlns:cb="http://www.cbwiki.net/wiki/index.php/Specification_1.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
                    <p>The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to reflect a revision to the loan restructuring adjustment associated with the revolving credit extended to American International Group, Inc. (AIG).  In addition, the release has been modified to incorporate fair value adjustments associated with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  </p>
<p>Consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the AIG revolving credit extension has been reduced by a revision of $1,255 million to the loan restructuring adjustment.  The restructuring adjustment is related to the loan modification that eliminated the floor on the Libor rate, announced on March 2, 2009, and that was first incorporated in reported figures beginning with the July 30, 2009, H.4.1 release.  The restructuring adjustment recognizes the economic effect of the reduced interest rate on the revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit extension. The revised restructuring adjustment incorporates quarterly updates as of December 31, 2009, of estimates of factors such as interest rates and future cash flow streams that are used to value the original loan restructuring adjustment.  The Federal Reserve expects that the credit extension, including interest and commitment fees under the modified terms, will be fully repaid.</p>
<p>The weekly average balance of the credit extended to AIG shown in table 1 reflects holdings from March 25, 2010, through Wednesday, March 31, 2010.*  The balance for the first six days of this reporting week reflects the loan restructuring adjustment prior to its revision.  The balance for the final day of the reporting week reflects the revised loan restructuring adjustment.  </p>
<p>Several items on the release have been modified to include fair value adjustments associated with the TALF.  A fair value adjustment to the TALF loans extended by FRBNY is recorded in "Other Federal Reserve assets" in table 1 and "Other assets" in table 10 and in table 11.  This fair value adjustment of $557 million reflects the value of the future interest received by FRBNY that is paid to the TALF LLC to provide credit protection.  The adjustment is substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the fair value of the liability to the U.S. Treasury related to its beneficial interest in the TALF LLC recorded in "Other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and "Other liabilities" in table 10 and in table 11.  The fair value adjustments associated with the TALF will be updated quarterly. </p>

                    <p>For release at<br />4:30 p.m. EDT<br />November 19, 2009</p>
<p>The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks," has been modified to include information related to TALF LLC, a limited liability company formed to purchase and manage any asset-backed securities that might be received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) in connection with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  This information will be presented in a new table 8, "Information on Principal Accounts of TALF LLC."  The release has also been modified to include information related to the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC.  This information is presented in table 1, in table 8, in table 9, and in table 10.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the TALF under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  Under the TALF, the FRBNY extends loans to eligible borrowers to finance the purchase of eligible asset-backed securities (ABS) that serve as the collateral for the loans.  The loans provided through the TALF are non-recourse, meaning that the obligation of the borrower can be discharged by surrendering the collateral to the FRBNY.  The loans are extended for the market value of the security less an amount known as a haircut.  As a result, the borrower bears the initial risk of a decline in the value of the security.  TALF LLC has committed, for a fee, to purchase all ABS received by FRBNY in conjunction with a TALF loan at a price equal to the TALF loan plus accrued but unpaid interest.  Purchases of these securities are funded first through the fees received by the LLC and any interest the LLC has earned on its investments.  In the event that such funding proves insufficient, the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) will provide additional subordinated debt funding to the TALF LLC to finance up to $20 billion of asset purchases.  Subsequently, the FRBNY will finance any additional purchases of securities by providing senior debt funding to TALF LLC.  Thus, the TARP funds provide credit protection to FRBNY.</p>
<p>
                      <br />The Federal Reserve has completed its evaluation and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of TALF LLC will be consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the FRBNY in the preparation of the statements of condition shown on the release. Although the U.S. Treasury provides credit protection to the FRBNY, the FRBNY is the more closely associated beneficiary of the LLC because it directs the significant financial activities of the TALF LLC. </p>
<p>
                      <br />The consequences of this consolidation appear on the release in the following ways.  Any extensions of credit from the FRBNY to TALF LLC are eliminated, as is the accrued interest on such loans.  The net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC are included in "total factors supplying reserve funds" in table 1 and in "assets" in table 9 and in table 10.  The liabilities of TALF LLC to entities other than the FRBNY are included in "other liabilities and capital" in table 1 and in "other liabilities and accrued dividends" in table 9 and in table 10.<br />Information on the principal accounts of TALF LLC is presented separately in a new table 8.  This table presents the net portfolio holdings of TALF LLC, which comprise the fair value of the ABS holdings of TALF LLC and other investments that result from the initial funding provided by the U.S. Treasury, fees paid by the FRBNY, and interest received on investments.  In addition, the table presents the book value of the outstanding principal of the loan extended by the FRBNY, the book value of the accrued interest payable to the FRBNY, and the book value of the funding provided by the U.S. Treasury to TALF LLC, which includes the accrued interest payable to the U.S. Treasury.<br />

                    <p>Effective with this release, several changes, summarized below, have 
been made to the data and the line items shown on the H.8 release. These 
changes relate to the adoption, as of July 1, 2009, of a single reporting 
form for all weekly reporters (see the Federal Reserve Board's notice 
published in the <i>Federal Register</i>, 74 FR 10739). Historical data 
have been revised to reflect these changes. In addition, data from the H.8 
release are now available for customizable download through the Federal 
Reserve Board's <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=H.8">Data 
Download Program (DDP)</a>. These data will be updated weekly with the H.8 
release. </p>
<OL>
<li>The line items on loans now include the loans that banks hold in 
trading accounts. Previously, loans that banks held in trading accounts 
were included in trading account securities. </li>
<li>Derivatives with a positive fair value and other trading assets are 
now shown as trading assets not included in bank credit. Previously, 
derivatives with a positive fair value and other trading assets were 
included in securities in bank credit. </li>
<li>The set of line items shown on the release has been changed.
<uL>
<li>The set of line items shown on the release is now identical for each 
bank group (all commercial banks; domestically chartered commercial banks; 
large domestically chartered commercial banks; small domestically 
chartered commercial banks; and foreign-related institutions in the U.S.). 
As a result, more line items are now shown on the release for small 
domestically chartered banks and foreign-related institutions. Data values 
that had not previously been reported by a bank group are denoted "--". 
Previously, the set of balance sheet items shown on the release differed 
substantially by bank group. </li>
<li>The line items on securities are now shown by issuer (Treasury and 
agency or other) and type of security (mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or 
non-MBS). Previously, securities were shown by account type (investment 
account versus trading account) for large domestically chartered 
commercial banks and foreign-related institutions, and detail on 
mortgage-backed securities was shown only for large domestically chartered 
commercial banks that held such securities in investment accounts. </li>
<li>Banks' allowance for loan and lease losses is now shown. </li>
<li>Some line items are no longer shown separately: security loans are now 
included in all other loans and leases; state and local government loans 
held in investment accounts by large banks are now included in other 
securities, non-MBS; transaction deposits are now included in deposits, 
other deposits; and nontransaction deposits are now included in deposits, 
large time deposits or in deposits, other deposits, as appropriate.</li> 
<li>Some memoranda items that were previously shown for large domestically 
chartered commercial banks have been eliminated: pass-thru mortgage-backed 
securities; CMO, REMIC, and other mortgage-backed securities. </li>
</uL> </li>
<li>The definitions of large and small domestically chartered commercial 
banks have been revised. 
<uL>
<li>Large domestically chartered commercial banks are now defined as the 
top 25 domestically chartered commercial banks, ranked by domestic assets 
as of the previous commercial bank Call Report to which the H.8 release 
data have been benchmarked. Previously, large domestically chartered 
commercial banks were defined as banks that reported the FR 2416 form 
(that form was discontinued as of July 1, 2009). </li>
<uL>
<li>If a large domestically chartered bank is acquired by a commercial 
bank or if a large bank leaves the commercial bank universe, then it is 
replaced with the bank next in line, typically the bank ranked number 26. </li>
<li>If a nonbank converts to a commercial bank charter, or if a small bank 
becomes large in size, it is not considered for the large bank panel 
(regardless of size) until the data are benchmarked to the subsequent Call 
Report. </li>
                          </uL>
<li>Small domestically chartered commercial banks are now defined as all 
domestically chartered commercial banks not included in the top 25. 
Previously, small domestically chartered commercial banks were defined as 
all domestically chartered banks that did not report the FR 2416 form. 
</li>
                        </uL>
                      </li>
<li>To the extent possible, the information available via the historical 
H.8 "Notes on the Data" link has been revised to incorporate the changes 
to the line items shown on the release. </li>

Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to decrease 0.3 percent this year after having expanded 1.5 percent in 2008. Manufacturing capacity is estimated to decline 0.6 percent in 2009 after having risen 1.7 percent last year. In 2009, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.8 percent, about the same as in 2008, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.7 percent, which is 0.5 percentage point slower than it had last year. With the publication on March 27, 2009, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Plant Capacity for the fourth quarter of 2008, which covers manufacturing.<br />

                  <description xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/" xmlns:cb="http://www.cbwiki.net/wiki/index.php/Specification_1.1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
                    <p>The H.3 statistical release indicates that nonborrowed reserves of depository institutions were negative for much of 2008 but more recently have turned positive.</p>
<p>By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to the sum of credit extended through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs and credit extended through certain Federal Reserve liquidity facilities.  Total borrowings from the Federal Reserve are presented in table 1a of the release.  Over much of 2008, in order to maintain a level of total reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's objective for the federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves were offset through a nearly commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which was accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities and other assets.  The negative level of nonborrowed reserves was an arithmetic result of the fact that borrowings from the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities were larger than total reserves.<br />
                    </p>
<p>More recently, nonborrowed reserves have again turned positive.  This development is purely an arithmetic result, in this case of the fact that a large volume of reserves has recently been provided through channels that, for purposes of the Federal Reserve's statistical releases, are not considered borrowings.  These channels include foreign currency swap arrangements with foreign central banks and certain special purpose vehicles.  Credit extended to these special purpose vehicles are not shown on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  Rather, as noted on the H.4.1 statistical release, the assets of these vehicles are consolidated onto the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and consequently credit extended to these special purpose entities is not treated as a borrowing for purposes of the H.3 statistical release.</p>

Thus the rates published after September 19, 2008, likely reflect the direct or indirect effects of the new temporary programs and, accordingly, likely are not comparable for some purposes to rates published prior to that period.<br />
                    <br />Through November 4, the documentation on the "About" page of this release indicated that paper issued under "credit-enhanced programs" was excluded from the samples of issues used to calculate reported rates.  This wording was intended to convey that asset-backed commercial paper was excluded from the calculation of financial rates.  Indeed, consistent with that intent, the Federal Reserve has, since 2006, published a separate rate series for asset-backed commercial paper.  To avoid confusion, the reference to "credit-enhanced programs" will be dropped.</description>

                      <strong>February 15, 2008:</strong> The data in this release include preliminary estimates of industrial capacity for 2008. Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to rise 1.9 percent this year after having expanded 1.8 percent in 2007. Manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase 2.1 percent in 2008, the same amount as in 2007. In 2008, mining capacity is estimated to expand 0.7 percent, and utilities capacity is projected to rise 1.9 percent; both rates of increase would be slightly faster than for last year. With the publication on March 28, 2008, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity, and capacity utilization, these estimates will be updated to reflect more-comprehensive source data, including the 2006 Survey of Plant Capacity, physical capacity data from government and trade sources, and the revised production indexes.</p>

                    <p>
The H.3 statistical release indicates that nonborrowed reserves of
depository institutions have declined substantially since mid-December
to a level that is now negative. This development reflects the
provision of a large volume of reserves through the Term Auction
Facility (TAF) and has no adverse implications for the availability of
reserves to the banking system.</p>

<p>By definition, nonborrowed reserves are equal to total reserves
minus borrowed reserves. Borrowed reserves are equal to credit extended
through the Federal Reserve's regular discount window programs as well
as credit extended through the TAF. To maintain a level of total
reserves consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's target
federal funds rate, increases in borrowed reserves must generally be
met by a commensurate decrease in nonborrowed reserves, which is
accomplished through a reduction in the Federal Reserve's holdings of
securities and other assets. The negative level of nonborrowed reserves
is an arithmetic result of the fact that TAF borrowings are larger than
total reserves.</p>

The seasonally adjusted data released on July 13, 2007--both the H.8
statistical release and the associated historical data--were based
inadvertently on a set of newly estimated seasonal factors. These
seasonal factors did not represent our final estimates and should not
have been published. <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
In today's H.8 statistical release and in the associated historical
data, we have restored the previous set of seasonal factors. In
addition, we have corrected the H.8 statistical release of July 13,
2007, by restoring the previous set of seasonal factors to those data.
We will publish newly estimated seasonal factors when they have been
finalized. </p>

<ul>
<li>
For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of large domestically chartered banks (pages 5 and 7), former item 12a, "State and local government" loans, and former item 12b, "Agricultural" loans, have been discontinued and the remaining three items under item 12 have been renumbered as 12a through 12c.  Data for the two discontinued items have been aggregated into renumbered item 12b, "All other loans."  
</li>  
<li>
For seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted assets and liabilities of small domestically chartered banks (pages 9 and 10), former item 11, "Security" loans, has been discontinued and data for this item have been aggregated into existing item 12, "Other loans and leases."

</li>
<li>
For memo items of large domestically chartered banks (page 13), former item 34, "Securitized business loans," has been discontinued.  On the same page, new item 34, "Securitized real estate loans," has been added to the memo items for both large and small domestically chartered banks.  
</li> 
</ul>
The data also reflect shifts in reporters between the large and small domestic bank reporting panels. </description>

                    <b>December 6, 2005: </b>The Federal Reserve will discontinue its survey of industrial electric power use with the publication on December 15, 2005, of data for October 2005. The response rate for the voluntary survey had dropped significantly since the early 1990s, with coverage in 2004 nearly 40 percent less than at its peak in 1993. With the publication of the annual revision to the G.17 on November 7, 2005, the monthly indicators for the industrial production indexes for the twenty industries that previously relied on electric power use were changed to production-worker hours for the period 1997 to the present. Although the indexes of electric power use will no longer be updated, the historical indexes will remain available from the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/download.htm">historical data page for the G.17</a>. A notice seeking comments on this action was originally published in the <i>Federal Register</i> on September 29, 2005; no comments were received during the public comment period, which ended on November 28, 2005.</description>

Most of these declines reflect some banks' decisions to stop consolidating their VIEs in response to the announcement by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on October 9 that it had decided to defer the implementation of its Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities from the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. For further information, please see the FASB website, <a href="http://www.fasb.org">www.fasb.org</a>. In addition, a small part of the decline reflects a restructuring of some VIEs so that they no longer need to be consolidated on bank balance sheets. <br />
                    <p>The balance sheet items affected are other securities, item 4, other loans and leases, item 12, and borrowings from others, item 24.

                    <p>
Monthly estimates of total bank credit and its major components,
seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, have been extended
back from January 1973, the former start date for all the bank credit
series, to January 1947. The components that have been extended are
holdings of U.S. government securities, holdings of other securities,
and the following loan categories: commercial and industrial, real
estate, consumer, security, and "all other."</p>

<p>Data in the H.8 are for all commercial banks in the United States,
which consist of domestically chartered banks and foreign-related
institutions (mainly U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks). The
data for 1973 through 1987 report totals for all institutions as well
as subtotals for domestically chartered banks and for foreign-related
institutions; beginning in 1988, the data are further disaggregated
between large and small domestically chartered banks. The extended data
(1947-72) show only all-institution totals.</p>

<p>As with the current data, the extended monthly data are prorated
averages of Wednesday values. The weekly Wednesday data underlying the
monthly averages mix actual historical observations with estimates that
are based on linear interpolations of semimonthly, monthly, and, in a
few cases, lower-frequency observations.</p>  

<p>Several bank credit series received generally minor revisions for
the 1973-87 period when the longer time series were introduced.</p>

                    <p>Effective with this edition of the H.8 statistical release, the Federal Reserve is discontinuing the publication of the District-specific balance sheet data of large, domestically chartered banks that appeared on pages 11 through 14 of the release. </p>
<p>The reason for the change is that, with the ability of banks to establish branches virtually nationwide as of June 1, 1997, a number of large bank holding companies have converted banks located across several Federal Reserve Districts into branches of a single bank. These consolidations have significantly shifted bank balance sheet items among Federal Reserve Districts, further weakening the connection between banking data reported separately by Federal Reserve District and actual banking activities in each District. </p>
<p>However, the item coverage of the aggregate balance sheets of large banks in the H.8 has been expanded to retain the national totals of some of the items in the District tables that had not appeared in the national tables. As a result, the H.8 now reports the large bank data on four pages rather than two. <br />

                    <p>As of the release dated February 25, 2002, the H.15 no longer
reports a 30-year constant maturity yield for Treasury securities and
begins reporting a yield for Treasury securities with 25 years or more
remaining to maturity.</p>

<p>The changes reflect the Treasury's announcement on January 30, 2002,
that, effective February 18, it would cease supplying an estimate of
the 30-year constant maturity yield and that it would commence
supplying a long-term yield based on a basket of long-dated securities.
</p>

<p>As indicated in footnote 12 of the release, the new long-term rate
is based on an unweighted average of the bid yields for all Treasury
fixed-coupon securities with remaining terms to maturity of at least 25
years. A factor to adjust the daily long-term average to estimate a
30-year rate is available at the Treasury web site reported in footnote
13 of the release.</p>

<p>Data for most of the interest rates reported in the H.15 release of
September 17, 2001, were missing for September 11-13 because of
inactive markets or delays in data processing arising from the
disasters of September 11.</p>

<p>On September 25 the Treasury released the data that had been
missing for September 13 regarding the constant maturity interest
rates on Treasury securities and the secondary rates on bills.  On
October 1, 2001, the Federal Reserve issued a revised version of the
H.15 release of September 17 to show the September 13 values of those
series and the correspondingly updated values of the averages for the
week ending September 14; also on October 1, 2001, the Federal Reserve
issued a revised version of the September 24 release to show the new
values of the averages for the week ending September 14.</p>

reporting secondary market yields for 1-year Treasury bills, the final
issuance of which was on February 27, 2001.</p>  

<p>Effective with the issue of September 4, 2001, the H.15 statistical
release reflects these changes by reporting the secondary market rate
for 4-week bills and by no longer reporting the secondary market rate
for 1-year bills. </p>

<p>In addition, the H.15 now reports a 1-month constant maturity rate,
which the Treasury began calculating when it introduced the 4-week bill.</p>
