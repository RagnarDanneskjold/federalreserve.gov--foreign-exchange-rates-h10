  <li>What is the best way to drive to the Board?</li> 
  <div class="answer">Please visit our <a href="directions.htm">Getting to the Board</a> web page for driving directions.</div>

  <li>What is the Board’s policy on crediting service and leave for new employees who transfer from a federal agency?</li> 
  <div class="answer">Whether your service or leave will transfer to the Board depends on many factors. If you receive an employment offer from the Board, we will encourage you to contact our benefits office for more details.</div>
          
  <li>Do you employ noncitizens? </li>  
  <div class="answer">
    
    The Board will hire any qualified  person who is a United States  citizen or who is not a citizen but meets the requirements of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/PUBLAW/HTML/PUBLAW/0-0-0-15.html">Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986</a> (IRCA).<br /><br />As required by law, the Board will not hire any person who is unable to satisfy the requirements identified in IRCA. In addition, citizens and nationals of the United States will receive preference in employment over equally qualified persons who are not citizens or nationals of the United States.</div>
          
  <li><strong>What type of positions/career opportunities are  available at the Board</strong>? </li> 
  <div class="answer">The Board has many professional and support positions. The key job families for which we recruit are economist, research assistant, attorney, financial analyst, and information technology professional. We also regularly have positions available  for law enforcement professionals and other administrative support technicians and will periodically recruit for interns and cooperative education students. Please visit  our <a href="default.htm">Career Opportunities</a> web site for a list of available positions.</div>
          
  <li>Does the Federal Reserve conduct on-campus recruiting? If so, do you publish a schedule of upcoming campus visits? </li> 
          
  <div class="answer">The Federal Reserve visits many colleges and universities each year. A schedule of our upcoming visits is on our <a href="default.htm">Upcoming Events</a> section on the home page of the Career Opporutnities web site. </div>
          
  <li>How do I apply for a position at the Board? </li>  
  <div class="answer">If you are applying for any position other than economist or research assistant, the Board prefers that you submit your application online.  Select the "submit resum&eacute;" button at the top of each job description on our web site.  Complete each section with the requested information, attach a resum&eacute;, and select the "submit" button at the bottom of the application.  The online application will be forwarded to the recruiter for review.<br /><br />If you are applying for a position as an economist or research assistant, select the "To apply" button after the job family description.  You will find specific information on how to forward your resum&eacute; to the Board.</div>
          
  <li>How can I find out the status of my application?</li>  
          
  <div class="answer">When you submit an application for a Board position, you will receive an e-mail notice advising you that your resum&eacute; has been received. We receive hundreds of applications for a posted position, and will contact only those applicants whose skills and qualifications best meet the requirements of the posted position. We do contact all applicants who interview for a position and are not selected. </div>
          
  <li>Generally how long does it take to fill a position?</li> 
  <div class="answer">Some positions can be filled in as little as three weeks, others may take longer. </div>
          
  <li> What should I include on my resum&eacute;?</li>  
  <div class="answer">The online application form includes all the information the Board requests from job candidates. You may also send a personal resum&eacute;, if you wish.</div>
          
  <li>Do I need a cover letter? </li> 
  <div class="answer">Although a cover letter is not necessary, attaching one with your application can help distinguish you from other candidates who apply for the same position. The online application we provide allows you to attach a cover letter with your application.</div>
          
  <li>Can I fax my resum&eacute;?</li> 
  <div class="answer">The Board prefers that you apply for available positions online through our <a href="default.htm">Career Opportunities</a> web site.</div> 
          
          
  <li>Do I need to apply through the Office of Personnel Management’s web site?</li> 
  <div class="answer">No, the Federal Reserve has its own Careers web site. Some positions may also be posted on the USA Jobs web site. </div> 
          
          
  <li>Once at the Board, when can I apply for a job in a higher grade?</li> 
  <div class="answer">If you are hired for a position at the Board, you are required to work in that position for six months before applying for other posted jobs. You may apply for any position you are qualified for within the Board. </div> 
          
  <li>Can I apply for opportunities at the Federal Reserve Banks through the Board? </li> 
  <div class="answer">

  <li>If I am selected for an interview, does the Board have security measures that I should be aware of? </li> 
  <div class="answer">
    
    Before arriving at the Board, we will  ask you for your date of birth and social security number to enter into our  visitor registration system.

Upon arrival, you will be required to show a valid state  driver&rsquo;s license or other acceptable photo identification. Please read the  Board&rsquo;s <a href="pdf/fr1273.pdf">Privacy Act notice (66 KB PDF)</a> to learn how the  Board protects your personal information.</div>
          
  <li>How do I contact the Board’s Recruitment Office by phone?</li>
  <div class="answer">
    To ask questions about positions posted at the Board or to check the status of your application, please contact the Board’s Recruitment office at (202) 452-3880. If you are hearing impaired, please call (202) 872-4984.<br /><br />
  </div> 
          
  <li>Does the Board have any restrictions on holding stocks in financial companies?</li> 
  <div class="answer">
    Board employees, their spouses, and minor children may not own debt or equity interests<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="f1"> </a>  in banks, thrifts or other depository institutions or their affiliates<a href="#fn1" title="footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="f2"> </a>.  While waivers may be available to permit retention of such interests acquired prior to Board employment, divestiture may be necessary for employees in certain divisions of the Board responsible for banking supervision. If you are applying to the Divisions of Banking Supervision & Regulation, Consumer & Community Affairs, or Legal, and you or your immediate family own financial institution securities, or if an immediate family member is employed by a banking organization, you should discuss these issues with the Board’s  recruiter.<br /><br /><br />
